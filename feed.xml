Then just put them in your work when the rightsized hole gapes.</p>

<p>I did this while writing <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a>.
I suppose it shows, the hodgepodge it is.
It’s not the easiest thing to pull off.
But when you do, it expands your work in dimension.
Instead of giving your audience a line to trace from start to point to point to end, you entangle them in a web of ideas and draw their attention to the meaningful ways they come into contact.
Several lines of thought intersect in an intricate nexus then split off in tangential directions each worth pursuing.
That’s how it is in reality anyhow.</p>

<p>David Lynch’s enigmatic <em>Lost Highway</em> begins with a cryptic message murmured into the protagonist’s intercom.
<em>Dick Laurent is dead.</em>
This message came to Lynch not from the depths of his subconscious mind but from his own intercom.
Puzzled, Lynch went to the window to try to get a look at the speaker but he struggled to get a view of the front of his house from inside.
For the film, Lynch bought a house and reconfigured the inside to reenact this whole scenario.
He plucked this strange moment from his personal experience and grafted it onto a film inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial, another event that he was compelled to translate into art.</p>

<p>Lynch is no doubt an eccentric but <a id="2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/live-in-the-moment-2">curated appropriation from real life</a> seems to be a common practice among artists.
Paul Harding, whose debut novel <em>Tinkers</em> won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, tells in <a href="https://youtu.be/roLRPQPQU58?si=8azqvMoN7Jksu4ti">this interview</a> that he likes to insert into his work the things he is interested in at the time of writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I let everything I’m interested in at the moment I’m writing into the book…If it all comes from my mind and I’m interested in all of it, it is going to be like a stand of Aspen trees…Aspen trees look like they’re different trees, but actually they all have the same root system, it’s actually one organism…I love having a bunch of stuff that’s just floating around in a manuscript for years and I’m like, I have <em>no</em> idea how you belong but I think you do.</p>

<h3 id="january">January</h3>

<h3 id="february">February</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Microsoft expects all employees living within a fifty mile radius of the headquarters in Redmond to be present in office an average of three days per week.
The new rule was announced in September 2024 and it takes effect at the end of February.
And so tens of thousands of employees will begin commuting to campus to do the job they’ve been doing at home for the last six years.</p>

<h3 id="march">March</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
March will mark four years since I transferred from Excel to Loop.</p>

<h3 id="april">April</h3>

<h3 id="may">May</h3>

<h3 id="june">June</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Soon after June begins, the World Cup will begin as well.
The first in the Americas in my lifetime.
I don’t have a bucket list but if I did Attend the World Cup would certainly be on it.</p>

<h3 id="july">July</h3>

<h3 id="august">August</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Z is preparing applications for graduate programs at universities across Canada.
Depending on where she is accepted, August will likely be our month for settling into a new home.
It will also be the month I turn thirty.
I don’t feel anxiety about it, at least not yet.
We’ll see how I feel as the date approaches.
I’m in good shape for it though, I think.
Married, gainfully employed, established in my career, financially secure, spending time on things I care about.
I am as I probably should be – satisfied with my life’s yield, enjoying the fruits of my university labors.
I was greatly privileged by the opportunities afforded me and I took them.
While I was in school and for years thereafter I saw Computer Science degrees as a surefire catapult into stable and lucrative employment.
Hell, for me it served as runway for easy immigration into the USA.
It is only in retrospect that I appreciate that even the timing of my graduation in 2019 was fortunate.
It was a sellers market.
Even people with minimal education and experience in programming were getting job offers.
It was a gold rush.
It peaked in 2021 and since then it has been correcting.
In wave after wave thousands upon thousands of employees have been laid off over the last few years not by failing startups but by huge and enormously profitable tech companies.
I transferred within Microsoft from Excel to Loop in March of ‘23.
Loop was recruiting openly within the Office organization and all management levels above me were promoting “talent mobility.”
Layoffs had begun happening at Microsoft and in the industry at large, but it felt like a distant threat.
And yet one of my fellow engineers at Excel passed up the opportunity to join Loop because he feared that new recruits would be likely targets if layoffs continued.
I figured he didn’t have much to worry about.
Two years later, however, layoffs did reach us.
But the affected employees turned out to be those with <em>most</em> years of service at Microsoft.</p>

<h3 id="september">September</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
If by September I continue working at Microsoft I will complete seven years of work there, and nearly two as a senior engineer.</p>

<h3 id="october">October</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Again next year I will organize spooky movie viewings at home with friends.
I’m not big into Halloween or anything but I love movies and it feels nice to let the season influence my activities.
The rain and the cold and the dark of fall ushers us into the soft warmth of living rooms to spend time in restful company of friends and loved ones.
When it comes to picking a spooky movie, it doesn’t matter to me that it adhere to the theme of Halloween.
To me it matters much more that it is first of all a good movie and secondly that it creates a moody, eerie atmosphere.
Some friends of mine are sticklers for a theme.
Last October (2024) they put on some Halloween-y music and I queued <em>Brujas</em> by Princess Nokia because it means <em>Witches</em> in Spanish and because it has a dark, moody vibe.
They were bewildered – <em>who put on hip hop?</em>
They restored order by skipping to <em>Monster Mash</em>.
Then they followed up with some spooky sounds like Chains Rattling and Wolf Howling and stuff like that.
I don’t know, for me, the point is to to set an enjoyable mood with enjoyable music.
Who cares how many lateral steps you take?
In <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2m7AVWn6qXUx2y7Ek6BIFd?si=611ba661a9d14a9b">my Halloween playlist</a> I take several to round up good tracks like <em>Scared Money</em> by NxWorries and <em>Time of the Season</em> by The Zombies.
I’ll admit it’s a pretty crude mix still.
But I’ve forgotten to work on it for the last several Halloweens.
Maybe next year.</p>

<h3 id="december">December</h3>

<p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
If our trip to the Yucatan peninsula in December of 2025 goes well, we will likely want to get away to somewhere warm again.
It might be a good opportunity to visit my family that lives in Honduras.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This piece is a second experiment in live journaling.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">how to revise a sentence #6</title><link href="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/revise-a-sentence-6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="how to revise a sentence #6" /><published>2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/revise-a-sentence</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/revise-a-sentence-6"><![CDATA[<p>Here is the progression of a sentence <a id="2025-01-18-my-2025" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/2025">I wrote today</a> from first draft to final form.
<!--more-->
These iterative versions don’t capture all the edits I attempted, they are snapshots taken along the evolution of the sentence.</p>

<p>Seeing how it grew in length reminds me of Verlyn Klinkenborg’s claim that long sentences are just <a id="2023-02-25-several-short-sentences" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/several-short-sentences">several short sentences</a> put together and that write a long sentence we must begin by learning how to write a short one.
In fact by the end I finish with two, one long one shorter.</p>

<p>I notice that new images and phrasings spring up between drafts.
<strong>The PNW</strong> turns into <strong>coast cities of the PNW</strong>.
<strong>Encroach</strong> appears and then does the <strong>gray blanket</strong>.
And the explicit name of <strong>joy</strong> disappears so that its feeling may be <a id="2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/make-instead-of-describing">conveyed rather than stated</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The sunshine and cool air of September in the PNW brings me joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending with <strong>brings me joy</strong> felt weak.
Not sure why.
Maybe because it is preceded by a much larger subject?
So I tried moving <strong>joy</strong> to the beginning of the sentence and giving it a more central role as the active verb <strong>rejoice</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I rejoice in the sunshine and cool air of September in the coastal cities of the PNW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I dislike long dependent clauses like <strong>of September in the coastal cities of the PNW</strong>.
Maybe because they plod on boringly?
Or because they give the reader a bunch of contextual facts to apply rationally and retroactively?
Better to set the scene by cruising into it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the coastal cities of the PNW September maintains the summer sunshine as it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t even finish that attempt.
Another impulse, one to put September at the forefront, hijacked control:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In September the coastal cities of the PNW maintain summerlike sunshine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I aborted and retraced similar steps with a few additions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In September along the coast of the PNW summerlike sunshine remains a while as the air cools but before sunsets encroach on the afternoons</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Along</strong> is a nice addition and <strong>remains a while</strong> is a nice substitute for <strong>maintain</strong>.
These two along with the phrase <strong>as the air cools</strong> contribute to a pleasant sense of temporal and spatial continuity.
Our view of the coast is panning instead of static and the air is not just cool but in the process of cooling.
The sunshine is lingering.</p>

<p>I was also pleased with the image of <strong>sunsets encroach</strong>ing.
It expresses that their approach is unwelcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In September, before sunsets encroach on the afternoons, along the coast of the PNW summerlike sunshine remains a while as the air cools but</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this one I begin the separation of before and after.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before October, when the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the last of the summer sunshine peters out, we have September here in the coastal PNW</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I solidify the before and after.
Or I suppose the after and before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the last of the summer sunshine peters out, we have the cooling air and warm sunshine of September.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Setting regains its footing at the front.
It applies cleanly to the two pieces that followg, the after and before.</p>

<p>At this point I realize that <strong>the last of the summer sunshine</strong> and <strong>warm sunshine</strong> are repeating the same idea and undermining the juxtaposition of the after and before.
They’re both sunny?
Sounds like October is pretty similar to October then, apart from the earlier sunsets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in the coastal cities of the PNW before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the sky, we have September.
It is a brief period of balance, of cool air and warm sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah!
Attention to the tension of redundant <strong>sunshine</strong> has yielded a lovely new image!
And one that completes the intended contrast between October and September.
Very nice.</p>

<p>I also split off the description of September’s weather and atmosphere into a separate sentence so that September can have its dramatic entrance.
<strong>We have September.</strong>
Woah, what’s up with September?
Not much I would’ve thought, but apparently it’s the last bastion before a dreary autumn.
The momentum of that question provoked carries us into the next sentence, where its answer lies.</p>

<p>At this point I feel I have found my sentence’s form.
Now to make little improvements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the sky, we have September.
A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I add the commas back in to slow things down and build up more dramatically to September’s entrance.
I also prune <strong>warm</strong> because <strong>sunshine</strong> is already warm and because doing so balances <strong>sunshine</strong> with <strong>cool air</strong>.
Two syllables each.
But, more importantly, it <em>feels</em> balanced, which is what the sentence is all about.
The seemingly contradictory description of <strong>soft crunchy</strong> serves the same purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets begin encroaching on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the daytime sky, we have September.
A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another couple tweaks.
Spreading <strong>sunsets encroach</strong> into <strong>sunsets begin encroaching</strong> enhances the feeling of continuity and motion we discussed before.
Adding <strong>daytime</strong> to <strong>sky</strong> sharpens the reference to the lost sunshine.</p>

<p>A long way way from where we started:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sunshine and cool air of September in the PNW brings me joy.</p>

<!--more-->
Nine times out of ten I will choose to live in a building of modest size.
About towers I despise the long, corporate-feeling hallways, the endless fobbing at locked doors, and the tedious elevator wait.
I love instead a sense of place, neighborly acquaintance, and easy access to the street.
It’s true, architecture of “human scale” is much better.</p>

<p>And yet I find it hard to argue against towers in cities desperate for housing.
How else are we supposed to create many dwellings quickly?
Over and over at zoning hearings at Vancouver’s city council the same old men crop up to rail against towers.
They cast shadows!
They’re too big for the neigborhood!
They will drive up prices!
They’re good for greedy developers and no one else!
The council is corrupt!</p>

<p>For alternatives these guys make passing gestures at “reasonable” building heights of eight to twelve stories, but it’s hard to believe they mean it.
It’s only because the proposals are for buildings of 30, 40, 50 stories that these guys are willing at all to entertain housing of greater density than already exists.
Take for example <a href="https://heritagevancouver.org/top10-watch-list/2016/7-commercial-drive/">this article</a>, which sounds the alarm on prospective development on Commercial Drive, one of Vancouver’s liveliest and most attractive neighborhoods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Vancouver continues to densify, the pressures to develop this area to the current permitted four-storey height limit could create a dreary blandness that would destroy what is important about ‘The Drive.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Four storey buildings?
That’s what you’re so worried about?
In 2016?
Are you kidding me?</p>

<p>It’s the great plot twist we should’ve all seen coming, that these NIMBYs faithfully fighting to preserve good city life by declaiming against towers for their unlivability, their “luxury” prices, and the opportunists building them are themselves the greedy ones, hoarding the <a href="https://youtu.be/pbQAr3K57WQ?si=sCfhPfhzczHMfVMa">most luxurious of housing types</a> – single family homes – and leaving eventually no option but to build towers.
Because towers would not be necessary if over long periods of time densification were allowed to happen in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_middle_housing">medium-density housing</a> in the areas that demand it.
But no!
New buildings are gross!
Yuck!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="cities" /><category term="vancouver" /><category term="urbanism" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I must concede one point to the NIMBYs – towers do not make ideal housing.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">how to come up with ideas #3</title><link href="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/come-up-with-ideas-3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="how to come up with ideas #3" /><published>2025-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/come-up-with-ideas</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/come-up-with-ideas-3"><![CDATA[<p>Fifteen minutes before a work meeting I wander out into the neighborhood to sit idly in the sunshine.
<!--more-->
I settle on a boulder in the park across the street and find myself looking at the bike polo rink and the small netted goals lockchained to its edge.
There a few months prior my friend and I played an impromptu pickup game with some neighborhood kids and on another day with another friend I returned to kick a ball around.
I play soccer regularly in a local league but somewhat regret the cost, which seems too high especially considering there are no referees.
Because of that, I sometimes daydream about starting a grassroots nonprofit soccer league and now sitting in the park looking at the bike polo rink I slip back into that daydream.</p>

<p>What about a nonprofit futsal league?
I rarely see the rink in use.
The goals are there, I’d just need to request or rent them.
Those smaller ones look perfect, no goalkeeper would be necessary.
Already on the rink’s surface there are lines demarcating the little zones where the goals should be placed.
To prevent players from squatting on the goalline there could be a rule disallowing players from entering the zone, it’s a fairly common one in smallsided games.
But then the game would probably devolve into bickering about whether someone stepped across the line or not.
When it’s up to the players to call fouls there’s always one that spends half the game a partisan referee.
Better minimize the number of rules.
I could post flyers around the neighborhood to gauge interest.
Just last night I saw a woman posting flyers on lightposts and then pedaling off down the road, probably to the next intersection where posted flyers were likely to be noticed.
I could call it the Cooper Park Futsal League, its location would be right there in the name.
It could start here and then federate out to other neighborhood parks as awareness and interest burgeons.
But really I should just start with a proof of concept.
A one-off game among friends.
It would be so easy.
I could do it right now.
Walk home, text my friends, set a date, and book the rink online.
I don’t mind coughing up the startup cost of a futsal ball.
But we don’t even need that yet.
We can just start with a regular soccer ball.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journal" /><category term="essays" /><category term="creativity" /><category term="thinking" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen minutes before a work meeting I wander out into the neighborhood to sit idly in the sunshine.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">what I’m doing now #16</title><link href="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now-16" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="what I’m doing now #16" /><published>2025-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now-16"><![CDATA[<p>Gearing down.
<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="gearing-down">gearing down</h3>

<p>I find myself coming down a wave of energy, waning in my motivation for work after a multiweek surge to solve various technical challenges.
I have learned a lot and shed insight into heretofore unknown problems in our system, but I still haven’t solved the main problem.
Week after week I resumed work with appetite and drive, but now I feel a bit deflated and tired.</p>

<p>I am consciously riding this ebb in energy without panicking or chastising myself because I know it’s part of my natural rhythm.
In the past I’ve responded with worry and guilt, which have only drained me further.
This time I’m trying to adapt to it instead of resisting or rejecting it.</p>

<p>Instead of responding reactively by hounding myself to keep up the pace or reacting avoidantly by procrastinating work in general, I am trying to respond with composure.
I am allowing the intensity of my workrate to subside without letting it stall.
To do so I am allowing myself the small periods of rest as I need them so that I can continue making incremental progress without overdrawing from my energy reserves.
I am letting my mind wander and indulging my curiosity so that motion can result naturally from unforced motivation.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll <a id="2025-09-23-come-up-with-ideas" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/come-up-with-ideas-3">start a nonprofit futsal league</a> in my neighborhood.
Or not.
I don’t have to.
Regardless, such daydreams generate a mild excitement that serves as cheap fuel to carry me forward and prevent my stagnation.
Better to maintain modest momentum than let things come to standstill until I can muster a jolt to start again.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearing down.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">what I’m doing now #15</title><link href="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now-15" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="what I’m doing now #15" /><published>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/now-15"><![CDATA[<p>Doing laundry, swapping chores, and reformulating “attention ecologies.”
<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="doing-laundry">doing laundry</h3>

<p>At the Catholic high school I attended there was a family of six children whose mother was a devout Christian and would bless each one of them as she folded their clean laundry.
I am not religious, but do find that <a id="2025-09-10-think-with-your-body" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/think-with-your-body-2">doing laundry is like a ritual</a>.</p>

<h3 id="swapping-chores">swapping chores</h3>

<p>When I am a parent perhaps the responsibility of family laundry will fall on me.
The ideal way to divvy up chores is to assign each to whomever is naturally motivated to do them.
Recently I took up the responsibility of filling the dishwasher because piles of dirty dishes bothered me so much.
When it was Z’s responsibility, I would fret about when it would get done.
Not because she procastinated excessively but because I had little control over it.
The reverse was true about vacuuming the apartment.
Z would stress about the dust and hairs settling along the walls of our apartment and periodically she would complain that I didn’t vacuum enough.
Finally I realized how foolish we were being and we swapped chores.</p>

<h3 id="reformulating-attention-ecologies">reformulating “attention ecologies”</h3>

<p>While hanging up my laundry, I finally found a crisper way of thinking about <a id="2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/attention">ecologies of attention</a> and how they work.
We consider our character and our attitude to be determinants of our behavior and overlook the influence of our physical and cultural environments.
Environments matter because they dictate what we perceive, what and whom we interact with, and how we interact.
Through those means they influence what we pay attention to and by extension what we care about.
There is a loop here involving perception, attention, interaction, and values.

<!--more-->
Like showering, it’s a task that requires no special effort.
You do it idly and you always succeed at it, and in the meantime your mind is free to wander.</p>

<p>When the washing machine finishes its cycle, I take my freshly laundered clothes to the spare bedroom for hanging up.
I hangdry my clothes to avoid the damage dryers do.
I hang one article of clothing at a time, balancing each one in its own section of the drying rack and then stretching it gently to allow for quicker drying.
The socks I hang in the little slots that exist for them at both ends of the rack.
I take my time.
Hurry would save an insignificant amount of time at the cost of the unnecessary stress that fuels urgency.
And I enjoy the process anyway, so I partake in it mindfully.</p>

<p>This ordinary little ritual bestows on each article of clothing a brief but special moment of attention.
During this act of care I find in myself arising a feeling of affection for my clothes.
They are for me and I take care of them and because of that they last longer and while they do I continue to enjoy and care for them.
Because I value them, to hanging them up I dedicate time and attention which in turn reaffirms their value in my esteem.</p>

<p>How I perceive my things determines how I interact with them.
But the reverse is also true.
How I interact with them recasts my perception of them.
These two tiny processes link together into selfsustaining loops.
Positives loops and negatives ones as well.</p>

<p>Perception varies drastically depending on the kind of attention that carries it.
<a id="2021-04-25-work" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/work">To perceive something new, we must loosen our attention.</a>
Mindless tasks like showering and doing laundry are <a id="2024-12-22-ecologies-of-attention-2" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/attention-2">perfect for this</a>.
A wandering mind picks up fresh leads, it notices subtle things like my quiet feeling of affection.
To perceive at all, we cannot be distracted.</p>

<p>Digital screens make it so difficult to remain engaged with the people sitting next to you because they interrupt steady attention before it can develop in its own time.
And when a screen is not already <a id="2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/attention">on the wall of the room we’re in</a> – be it in a private home or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub">public house</a> – we produce them from our pocket.
We do so not despite but <em>because</em> we know it will distract us.
In idleness our minds begin to wander and we sense it intuitively and cut off the stream of thought before it leads us into the whitewaters of anxiety.
And it works.
We interact with our device, perceive through it like a digital telescope something novel and remote, and find our attention thankfully diverted.
We don’t engage with our negative thoughts.
We don’t engage with idle thoughts at all.</p>

<p>But idle thoughts are pending items <a id="2021-02-01-think-invisibly" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">our subconscious brings to us</a> for our consideration.
We may reject them, but they will return.
And when they do, we repeat our defense.
A negative loop.</p>

<p>To care about something we must pay attention to it.
Ignoring our thoughts is selfneglect.
One way to engage safely with thoughts that seem too intense to handle is to use your body.
Don’t just sit there and think.
Move.
Alleviate some of the emotional burden of confronting your thoughts by diverting some of your attention.
Interact physically with the world.
Play a sport, play a game, go for a walk, wash dishes, do laundry.
Don’t just go on your phone.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="psychology" /><category term="attention" /><category term="perception" /><category term="anxiety" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like doing laundry.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Theatre takes place all the time</title><link href="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/theatre-all-the-time" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Theatre takes place all the time" /><published>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/theatre-all-the-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://okjuan.github.io/vbook/theatre-all-the-time"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Theatre takes place all the time, wherever one is. And art simply facilitates persuading one this is the case.

</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote by John Cage that I encountered in <em>The Medium is the Massage</em>, professor Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore’s idiosyncratic book.
I thought immediately of my piece <a id="2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/live-in-the-moment-2"><em>how to live in the moment #2</em></a>, where I talk about art as a means for capturing special moments of everyday life.</p>

<p>Until recently, every time I encountered a quote by an artist that echoed something I’d written, I would eagerly try to incorporate the quote into my piece retroactively.
I did this multiple times to <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-invisible-thinker-c5ee42b4bb5"><em>The Invisible Thinker</em></a> with quotes from David Lynch, Cormac McCarthy, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
The quotes were relevant, but I came to regret inserting them into a piece I might already consider whole.
It’s difficult to make changes to a finished piece while preserving its flow and cohesion.</p>

<p>So I’ve been thinking about this problem.
How to collect quotes and connect them to existing pieces without forcing on them undue modifications.
Here is a new kind of attempt.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="quotes" /><category term="art" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Theatre takes place all the time, wherever one is.

<p>I might start a Substack “blog” called <em>Footie is Life</em> where I might talk about all the sustenance a simple game can provide for people.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-pulling-up-roots-before-settling-down">thinking of pulling up roots before settling down</h3>

<p>Z and I have come to a hilltop in the undulating journey of our lives and have now in sight a vast plateau, a fertile and stable ground where we will set down for a while to create and nurture a new family.
To that place, from our position now, we measure the last length of our youth – if that indeed it can still be called – an evershrinking space to roam carelessly before care becomes our primary concern.</p>

<p>Our trip to Ireland has widened our eyes, shown us what we’ve been missing by aiming our travels at cities foremost and the time we’ve been wasting not spent exploring the landscapes of British Columbia.
This last realization in particular I clutch jealously, aware of having forgotten like insights before.</p>

<p>I’ve heard people online talk about “the importance of inconvenience.”
I’ve been thinking about something similar: the <a id="2025-08-28-restraint" class="internal-site-link" href="/vbook/restraint-3">importance of restraint</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thinking about many things.]]></summary></entry></feed>
