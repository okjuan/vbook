<h4 id="saturday-12212024--sunday-12222024--tokyo-first-time-at-an-izakaya">Saturday 12/21/2024 / Sunday 12/22/2024 – Tokyo, first time at an izakaya</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I flew @ 12:45pm directly from Vancouver (YVR) -&gt; Tokyo (NRT)</li>
  <li>Z slept while the rest of us ate at a nearby izakaya (drinks, raw tuna, cheese pancakes, potato croquettes, chicken karaage, etc.)</li>
  <li>chocolate ice cream bar at 7 Eleven on the way back to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Z &amp; I flew with Air Canada.
We upgraded to Premium Economy to avoid being stuck in a couple of middle seats.
It was expensive, but it made our flight much better.
I spent the whole flight reading and writing.
I read the first 150 pages of <em>Normal People</em> and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about it</a><p>, pausing only to eat meals.
I couldn’t believe it when it was announced that we were beginning our descent.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="monday-12232024--tokyo-a-day-of-shopping">Monday 12/23/2024 – Tokyo, a day of shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee nearby while Z &amp; my family ate breakfast at the hotel</li>
  <li>together took train to Shibuya City, then ate at a good conveyor belt sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>solo flat white @ The Roastery by Nozy Coffee on Cat Street</li>
  <li>solo browse MoMA Design Store &amp; other boutiques, bought tea towel from Hay</li>
  <li>solo walk thru Shibuya, fatigued from jetlag, got another coffee</li>
  <li>solo browsed robe store but did not find what I wanted</li>
  <li>with group again, bought hoodie @ Carhartt Work In Progress store</li>
  <li>bought shoes and slides @ Hoka store</li>
  <li>visit Tadao Ando’s public bathroom in Jingū-dōri Park, which was featured in the movie <em>Perfect Days</em>
</li>
  <li>Shibuya crossing! then very spicy ramen at a place with weird vibes</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing.
Same thing this time in Tokyo for the first 24 hours.
Reactine didn’t seem to make a difference, just had to wait it out.</p></div>

<h4 id="tuesday-12242024--tokyo">Tuesday 12/24/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>arrived at Disney Sea @ 12pm</li>
  <li>rode on lots of rides, walked a lot, listened to Disney Xmas carollers</li>
  <li>subpar pizza &amp; pasta in Little Venice</li>
  <li>explored the rest of the park, rode on more rides, fought jetlag</li>
  <li>left @ 9pm, closing time</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The architecture and spatial planning of the theme park was really impressive.
It seemed like every corner we rounded we encountered another stridebreaking view of the park.
It reminded me of the architectural tactic of constraining the height and width of hallways to reinforce the impact of emerging into a bigger space.
It’s a method that’s been employed by Tadao Ando of Osaka and other famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-12252024--tokyo">Wednesday 12/25/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk through the Shimbashi area getting a couple of coffees</li>
  <li>Z &amp; I explored Ebisu on foot, stopping at a puppy store and a pharmacy</li>
  <li>cocktails @ bar EAS MOR, which had great atmosphere</li>
  <li>visited mall briefly, then dinner @ Toki Taruza withe everyone</li>
  <li>7 Eleven for snacks on the way to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="thursday-12262024--tokyo---takayama">Thursday 12/26/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>get two flat whites from INCredible Coffee</li>
  <li>took bullet train @ 1pm to Takayama via Nagoya</li>
  <li>dinner at a nice sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>fell asleep by 9pm, finally cured my jetlag</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train’s platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn’t enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying to scan our IC card after inserting the tickets.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It’s good we came an hour early.</p></div>

<h4 id="friday-12272024--takayama">Friday 12/27/2024 – Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>while Z had breakfast at the hotel, I walked into town and had coffee @ Brand New Day and then @ Hids’ Cafe</li>
  <li>at Miyagawa Morning Markets we bought a beef bun, a fridge magnet, two pairs of chopsticks, and two ceramic mugs</li>
  <li>pop into a cutlery store and then have lunch &amp; coffee @ Ember coffee in beautiful 150+ yearold house</li>
  <li>walk up hill to Shoren-ji Temple, enjoying the snowy scenery</li>
  <li>back in town, stop at stationery store</li>
  <li>I bought a yukata at a kimono store</li>
  <li>dinner @ ramen restaurant</li>
  <li>incredible cocktails @ Yu</li>
  <li>thirty minutes in a private onsen w/ Z at the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This was one of the best days of the trip.</p></div>

<h4 id="saturday-12282024--takayama---shirakawago---kanazawa">Saturday 12/28/2024 – Takayama -&gt; Shirakawago -&gt; Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk over fresh snow into town for coffee @ Falò Coffee Brewers, then got cash from post office ATM, then coffee @ Ember, before returning to hotel</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Shirakawago</li>
  <li>delicious snacks and drinks from window shop on street</li>
  <li>walk through village, across pedestrian bridge over the river, to the museum, and then back</li>
  <li>coffees &amp; Baum stick</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Kanazawa, then food &amp; drinks @ Pari King nearby</li>
  <li>beer &amp; instant ramen in the hotel room</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sunday-12292024--kanazawa">Sunday 12/29/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I had breakfast &amp; coffee at Isotope Coffee, a beautiful space</li>
  <li>solo stroll through town listening to music and taking pictures</li>
  <li>drank coffee and <a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about <em>Normal People</em></a><p> at Townsfolk Coffee</p>
</li>
  <li>Z met me and we walked north through Omigi Market for dinner at a fine dining restaurant called Barrier</li>
  <li>we walked through the Higashi Chaya District</li>
  <li>Z went to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I sat at a small pub to read <em>Normal People</em> &amp; drink beer</li>
  <li>we had cocktails at Furansu Cocktail Bar, which bartender at Yu in Takayama had recommended</li>
  <li>bites and drinks at Izakaya Hanagumi</li>
  <li>spent the rest of the night at Donuts Music Bar</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="monday-12302024--kanazawa">Monday 12/30/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast &amp; coffee at Moron Cafe</li>
  <li>visit beautiful Samurai house with an exquisite garden and a small gallery of artifacts</li>
  <li>coffee @ Townsfolk Coffee, then a brief stop at a combini store</li>
  <li>walk through to Oyama Shrine, through gardens, up to Kanazawa Castle ruins, down past Kenroku-en Garden</li>
  <li>Z took the bus to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I walked through Shiinoki Green Space back to the hotel</li>
  <li>I rested &amp; read <em>Normal People</em> in the room</li>
  <li>met Z for dinner nearby, but Love For All’s kitchen was closed so we went to The Cottage</li>
  <li>stop at Lawson, then back to hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tuesday-12312024--kanazawa---tokyo">Tuesday 12/31/2024 – Kanazawa -&gt; Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>taxi to station, ate while we waited for our train</li>
  <li>arrived in Tokyo, train to Shimbashi, checked back into the hotel</li>
  <li>rested a couple hours at the hotel</li>
  <li>dinner @ Daigo, a fancy Shojin restaurant</li>
  <li>karaoke @ Big Echo</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We were en route to Kanazawa Station by taxi when a thunderstorm hit.
Lightning flashed outside the windshield so brightly I thought our driver had run a red light and triggered a stoplight camera.
Still we asked to get dropped at a coffee shop a block away from the station so I could get a good coffee.
But then we found the shop was closed for New Years so we frantically lugged our bags back to the taxi to catch it before it left.
The train station was big and busy with travelers.
It was basically a mall with a train station.
White artificial light and Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift came down from the ceiling everywhere.
We settled in a Tully’s Coffee lounge with our bags piled around our ankles.
The far wall was decorated with a sappy, nonsensical poem marketing <em>&amp; Tea</em>.
We might as well have been in a mall in Jakarta or Mexico City or someplace else.
I hate places like these.
When you’re there, you don’t feel like you’re anywhere.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-01012024--tokyo">Wednesday 01/01/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>coffee &amp; breakfast @ Starbucks</li>
  <li>visit fancy mall where teamLAB is</li>
  <li>watched Gladiator II @ 109 Cinemas</li>
  <li>ramen dinner nearby</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It was certainly a mistake to visit Japan in the first few days of January.
As noted all over the internet, New Years is Japan’s major national holiday and many things close not only on the first but for a week.
I’m sure Z would’ve determined this if we had been more involved in planning the trip.
Lesson learned, I suppose.</p></div>

<h4 id="thursday-01022024--tokyo">Thursday 01/02/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit various neighborhoods including Gakugei-daigaku, Naka-meguro, &amp; Ebisu</li>
  <li>visited two more Tokyo Toilet locations, designed by Masamichi Katayama &amp;	Kashiwa Satō</li>
  <li>incredible sushi @ Standing Sushi Nemuro Hanamaru in Ginza</li>
  <li>shop @ UNIQLO Flagship store</li>
  <li>cocktails @ La France in Ginza</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="friday-01032024--tokyo">Friday 01/03/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit Tokyo National Museum</li>
  <li>lunch &amp; coffee there</li>
  <li>Hello Kitty special exhibition and gift shop</li>
  <li>visit Senso-ji temple w/ Z</li>
  <li>solo walk in Asakusa area</li>
  <li>dinner w/ my friend H @ Monja Shichigosan then drinks at nearby pub</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/context">mixed feelings about the museum</a><p>.
Or, I don’t know, maybe I just needed a meal.
Or a better sleep.
Or to feel like I chose to go there.
Or to have had a period earlier in the day where I’d gotten to direct my attention to things of my choosing.
Or a period to produce something, so that I might be in a more </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/chart-moods">absorptive mood</a><p>.
That certainly makes me feel better about socializing aimlessly in the evening, when I feel like I’ve done something productive with my day.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="saturday-01042024--tokyo">Saturday 01/04/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee &amp; journaling @ City Bakery</li>
  <li>teppanyaki dinner w/ my mom on top floor of mall in Ginza</li>
  <li>visit the teamLAB Borderless Digital Art Museum</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Art Museum was really cool.
It was a dark maze on the bottom floor of a fancy mall where myriad projectors shone moving patterns and images of light on walls, floors, and ceilings.
This by itself might’ve been a gimmicky socialmedia tourist trap, but embedded throughout the large labyrinthine gallery were rooms where sculptural elements combined with light, music, and mirrors to create surreal experiences.</p></div>

<h4 id="sunday-01052024--tokyo---vancouver">Sunday 01/05/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Vancouver</h4>

<ul>
  <li>check out but leave bags at hotel</li>
  <li>solo cortado from Brooklyn Roasters in Ginza</li>
  <li>solo browse flea market &amp; buy orange tinted glass to use for cappuccinos at home</li>
  <li>pick up bags at hotel and take train to Narita</li>
  <li>flew directly @ 6pm from Tokyo (NRT) -&gt; Vancouver (YVR)</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My intention was to browse Hands and Itoya in Ginza, but I came across the flea market when I stopped for coffee by Ginza station.
There were dozens of stalls selling ceramics, porcelain, kimonos, jackets, bluedyed fabrics, and so on.
The orange tinted glass I bought was only 400 yen, less than three dollars in USD, and I could see it selling for tens times the amount at trendy stores in the USA and Canada.
I’m still sour about going to the East Vancouver “Flea Market” to find they charge an <em>admission fee</em> and sell priced up secondhand and vintagestyled clothing.</p></div>

    </div></div><p>.
<!--more-->
I move slowly around the apartment and touch things lightly as if trying not to wake someone up.
The calm I feel is exquisite.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s strangely soothing to say nothing for a time.
Z and I sometimes do this in the car without prior agreement.
The longer we go without saying anything, the more peaceful we feel.
I think it’s possible outside of regimented meditation to reap some of its benefits by foregoing habitual self-stimulation like chatting and listening to music to make space for felt moments of clarity.
In modern life we routinely cover up the mysteriously powerful sensations our bodies are capable of generating when idle and we therefore miss out on the cathartic experience of allowing those sensations to come to the front of our awareness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In retrospect this is something I’ve been learning to do over the last few years.
In 2020 I started going on runs through my neighborhood in Capitol Hill, Seattle and instead of listening to music I listened to the sound of my body striding over the concrete.
I revelled in the unusually quiet streets of the early Covid pandemic and the unexpectedly sunny spring of that strange year.
Birds, breeze, chatter, and from balconies the clapping of hands and ringing of bells to thank the work medical professionals were doing across the globe.</p></div>
