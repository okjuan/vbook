My two main problems with this movie are Jack Nicholson's character, Costello, and The Love Interest.
<!--more-->

Costello's little quips are corny.
"One guy had to die and with me it's normally the other guy".
This supposed brutal mob boss doesn't make me quake with fear as much as he makes me roll my eyes.

Female characters in this movie are flat as mirrors.
They exist to be seen by the male characters and to reflect them.
Fittingly, the two main characters share the only female "character" in the movie as their love interest! Lol!
