Really really good.
It shows that McCurdy is not just interested in telling her story but also interested in writing as a craft.

She shows a lot of restraint. The book consists of a hundred or so vignettes that span her first twenty-something years. She keeps them brief when they ought to be and she doesn't bore the reader with [unnecessary transitions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-02-25-several-short-sentences %}) or reminders. She keeps it moving while managing to be very clear and direct.

It's clear she put a lot of work into this.
Not just in writing, but in therapy.
Her hindsight is razor sharp and cuts through the thicket of emotional confusion she was lost in for much of her young life.
