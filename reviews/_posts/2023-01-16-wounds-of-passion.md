Really beautiful.
Poetic.
A bit repetitive.
<!--more-->
Experimental -- written non-chronologically and in two voices.
More about bell hooks' "emotional landscape" than the trajectory of her life.

Small picture: Persistent omission of commas.
Little-to-no dialogue.

Topics: feminism, misogyny, racism, intersectionality, childhood trauma, abuse, the craft of writing, poetry, aesthetics of life, relationships, "free love".

Related works in my eyes: Just Kids by Patti Smith and Educated by Tara Westover.
Like Patti Smith's __Just Kids__, this book tells of artists building and mutually nurturing each other's lives as artists.
Like Tara Westover's __Educated__, this book tells of the labor of carving out a woman's career in academia and the related development of her intellect and personhood; of journeying towards the light of independence and self-actualization out of the shadow of childhood trauma.
