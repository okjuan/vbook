Highly recommend to anyone interested in reading about time management.
This book has a radical message for you: give up hope.
<!--more-->
You're never going to finish.
Relearn what it means to spend your time well.
You have very little of it and your anxiety about not wasting it is founded on bad assumptions and impossible standards.

I'd rate this book higher if I had learned more from it.
I've thought lots about time management.

Sometimes I feel like Burkeman allows himself doubtful claims, but his ideas are interesting and useful nonetheless.
His writing is good, but [not great]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-03-09-coordinate-metaphors %}).

I enjoyed his anecdotes and references to other works.
The idea of pre-clock life blew my mind.
I hadn't thought about the relationship between clocks, time, industrialization, and wage-labor.
A great example of fundamental paradigms we don't question.
Pure ideology!
