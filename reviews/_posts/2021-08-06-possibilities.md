The audiobook narrated by Herbie is great.
His impression of Miles is hilarious.

It's not a beautifully written memoir like Just Kids, but it's a worthy story.
It's fascinating to see how Herbie's collaborations pushed his career forward; he reinvented himself over and over, being always curious about whether something could be done.
Herbie shows how openness, curiosity, and determination can keep your work interesting for a long, long time.
