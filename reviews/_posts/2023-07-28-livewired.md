Absolutely essential read.
Mind-bending and mind-expanding.

The essential concept is _Livewiring_.
It's a rebranding of brain plasticity that emphasizes its continuity.
Our brains change all the time, throughout our lives, hour by hour, minute by minute.

A fascinating example is sighted people learning braille with blindfolds on: with their sense of sight shut off, their brains reallocate the neural resources that _would've_ been used for their sense of sight to be used by their sense of touch.
(Is this why music sounds so good at night?)
This is also why blind people's other senses are heightened: those other senses, backed up by more brainpower, are higher resolution.

In fact, according to Eagleman, the struggle for neural real estate is so contentious that your sense of vision can't take a night off.
Eagleman theorizes that [dreams are nightly exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-05-29-interpret-your-dreams %}) of our visual muscles that exist to strengthen it against invasions from neighboring neural regions.

It is at the cost of this volatility that we gain our brain's extraordinary adaptability.
The fact that our mental capabilities are not genetically pre-programmed means that we rely on the world around us to do the programming.
And, as Eagleman illustrates through cases of severely neglected children, there are deadlines for our basic programming.
What we are neglected in early life we may be neglected forever.

Another essential concept is the "potato head" model of the brain: plug in any data source and your brain will make sense of it.
At first, the data is gibberish, but eventually your brain transforms it into a stream of immediate knowledge.
It transforms it into a sense.
(Eagleman explores this topic more in another of his books, _Incognito_.)
On this basis, Eagleman's lab develops skin-stimulating devices that aim to give sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf.
And it's not as far-fetched as you'd think.
