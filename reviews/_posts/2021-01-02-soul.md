It's exciting to see Black America represented in a Pixar movie: to hear Charles Mingus and A Tribe Called Quest, to see reflected the work ethic, family values, and sense of community.

It's too bad the story is generic and boring.
I feel like I've seen this movie many times before.

The movie has inspiring bits and sheds insight into the challenges of growing up and growing old, but its metaphors are bloated and messy, and the plot full of tedious twists and annoying loop holes.
Overall, underwhelming and disappointing.
