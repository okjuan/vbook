In typical fashion, Malcolm presents sociological ideas with fairly engaging narratives, clear structure, and decent academic support.

This book provides a simple model to understand social capital, making its message more cohesive than __How to Win Friends and Influence People__, for example, which relies on a flurry of "rules" to follow in order to have general success.

I really do recommend this book!
