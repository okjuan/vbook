I got some useful and interesting concepts from this book<!--more-->: sleep debt; MLST; 2-process model of sleep AKA opponent-process model of sleep; the biological clock; necessity of REM sleep; [theory of dreams]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-05-29-interpret-your-dreams %}) based on periodic signal emanating from base of the brain (I particularly liked the author's interpretation); stages of sleep; the possibility of falling asleep for only a split second; and more.
