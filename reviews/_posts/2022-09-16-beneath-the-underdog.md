It started with promise <!--more--> -- I love the tender way Mingus referred to his youthful self, his inner child: "my boy", "baby".
My heart broke for the abuse he endured and I looked forward to seeing mature Mingus process it.
Instead I encountered a man of ugly, paranoiac-narcissistic bravado.
The book felt like a grossly egotistical, delusional mistreatment of his psychological wounds.
I didn't believe many of his stories and pitied him often.

I picked up the book in hope of reading about an experience complementary to James Baldwin's; also assured by my love of memoirs and jazz.
But this was disappointing.
