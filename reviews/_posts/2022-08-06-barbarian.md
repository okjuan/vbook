A twisting plot with topical themes woven in elegantly. My main complaint is that they get the characters to tell you things that the story itself explains well enough.

Like when Tess tells AJ "Can't you see? She just wants you to be her baby!".
I think it would hit harder if the audience came to that realization by themselves.

Even more so at the end when AJ contemplates aloud whether he's good or bad and whether he can set aright his mistakes.
Don't say it!
It's already there in the story!

Spelling it out reminds the audience that they're watching something written by somebody and pulls them out.
Don't describe it -- [make it]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing %})!
