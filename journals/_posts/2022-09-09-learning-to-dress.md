In elementary school I chose my outfits for one thing: recess.
<!--more-->
And recess meant one thing: soccer.
Indoor soccer shoes, soccer shorts, and one of my soccer jerseys.
(I guess I didn’t carry stuff in my pockets back then.) I took those games during recess very seriously.
One time after scoring a goal I took off my right shoe (red and black Adidas Predators) to celebrate like Cuauhtémoc Blanco.
Instead of a crowd of fans I looked up at a big vine-covered wall.
Getting back up I realized one of the girls in my grade was looking at me.
She looked bewildered.

But the outfits weren’t just a practical matter.
I loved how they looked.
Especially when they had three stripes on the sleeves.
(My snooty snot-nosed self looked down on anything with four stripes.
Or, God forbid, five.) Around that time, Nike started designing bolder, retro-inspired jerseys for Club America, the Mexican soccer team I supported and Cuauhtémoc Blanco played for.
Intrigued, but devout to the three stripes, I drew and colored my own Adidas jersey designs and tacked them up on the corkboard above my desk.
I can probably still draw both logos from memory.
The Adidas one is trickier than you’d think.

Then I found out about Abercrombie & Fitch.
We didn’t have one in Mexico, so the prodigal sons strutting around in their polo shirts must’ve gone shopping in the States.
I wish I could remember what I thought about it at first.
Did I care? Some part of me must’ve known that little moose was bull.
But at that age intuition gives way easily to the cool kid decree.

A year or two later, I found out we would be moving to the U.S., right in time for me to experience a fabled American institution: middle school.
That summer, while our parents dealt with the logistics of moving a six-person family from Mexico City to the suburbs of New York, my siblings and I watched head-sickening amounts of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel.
This time it was my sister staring at me, as I took diligent notes from Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide.
My studious, competitive little self loved neat and simple rules, and relished the idea that they codified everything.

Ned’s tips were good, but it was his outfit that influenced me the most.
The open button-up with a t-shirt underneath was just—mwah.
(It’s fortunate I didn’t discover mirrored aviators until later.
I would’ve been too powerful.) I recreated it with Abercrombie button-ups and striped sweatpants from The Children’s Place.
(One big stripe was an admissible, if humbler, alternative to the three.) On more modest days I played it safe with my long sleeve graphic tee that read, in ice cube letters across the chest, Cool As Ice.

On those first few weeks I swaggered through the halls in my open button-up, savoring my authentique américain lifestyle.
Unfortunately, the quippy repartee I anticipated would happen in the busy halls wasn’t as natural in the secluded corner of the school, where the sixth grade lockers were.
Plus, opening a locker wasn’t the 3-second operation that TV had assured me existed mainly as backdrop for flirting between classes.
I don’t know at what summer camp all those Nickelodeon teens and pre-teens got their bank-heist finger agility.

Even lunch time was a sobering affair.
My idealized vision of middle school suffered a severe blow when the ever-grouchy ketchup-red-haired lunch lady rung up my lunch food at more than the three bucks my mom gave me.
Apparently I was supposed to look at the prices and add them up to a total, like an adult at a grocery store or something.
I figured the transaction was more cultural than monetary.
You give me lunch, I give you lunch money.

But the cool kid crowd whose law I now observed wasn’t concerned with button-ups, graphic tees, meese, or even stripes.
It was all about the shoes.
Skateboarding shoes, specifically.
Etnies, DCs, and, for those with bolder taste, Osiris high tops.
(Other cool kid crowds were innovating in different directions, with Ed Hardy t-shirts and such.) I wasn’t confident about how I’d look in a pair of chunky skate shoes.
Plus, I’d be sacrificing the ability to play soccer at a moment’s notice, which, up until this point, had been the North Star guiding my choice in shoes.
But eventually I went for it.
I bought membership into the group with a respectable bid: Nike SB 6.0s, the ones with the thick tongue.
At first, they felt like part of a costume, but eventually they felt natural.

In high school, one of my best friends was very amused by the semi-formal attire I changed into after class one day, hoping to impress an exchange student at a group dinner that evening.
(This was in the early 2010s, before “looking like a dad” could be positive.) To be fair, my outfit was nearly indistinguishable from our private school uniform.
I didn’t look like I was going out with my fellow 15 year-olds, but like I was going to evening mass.

It was tricky to dress my age given my dad’s impulse to impress his preferences on me and my brother during our gender-segregated trips to the outlet mall.
(Pobre niños, I only took them to Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein...) The boys enjoyed an efficient tour through the collared, emblemed world of business casual while the girls enjoyed going shopping.
(The gleeful shopping spree I went on before middle school — the one that allowed me to realize my Ned outfit — was casually sponsored by my mom; a breach opened in the gender divide that afternoon and I slipped into a world of abundant oks and yeah sures.) Luckily for me, my dad also highly approved of Adidas.
Actually, it was he who gave me the Impossible is Nothing poster that hung on my bedroom wall, featuring a looming Muhammad Ali, an arm-slinged Beckenbauer, and various other figures of iron resolve.

My dad also deserves credit for keeping many of his clothes for decades, despite the fact they didn’t fit him anymore.
(In the master bedroom of our house in Canada, my dad took the big walk-in closet and my mom the, um, lean-in closet.) In our late teens and early twenties, my brother and I mined my dad’s store of 80s and 90s attire for genuinely retro items.
It was like going vintage shopping, except the old man was no stranger.
And it was free.
(I guess thrift stores charge for the mystery.)

My kids are unlikely to enjoy the same inheritance.
At the peak of my “minimalist” phase — as my mom admiringly called it — I got rid of a lot of stuff.
Arguably, too much stuff.
My dad had to talk me out of getting rid of my school yearbooks.
I got rid of a Club America t-shirt from my days in the youth academy that was signed by then-teen Memo Ochoa, the talented up-and-coming goalie who, ten or fifteen years later, made outrageous saves at the 2018 World Cup in Brazil to deny the likes of Neymar.

I’m not sure it was the real academy, but it was real enough to summon a couple first team players for a meet-and-greet after practice one day.
Actually, I even got to stand on the field at the Estadio Azteca with my teammates before a league game and high-five the players as they came on.
Except that most of them didn’t stretch their hands far enough to make contact with us.
I remember feeling quite annoyed.
I guess that was easier than feeling disappointed.

I also gave away a red polo shirt embroidered with the name of a weekend camp I went to in elementary school, Rancho Viejo.
I didn’t care for the shirt — I had no shortage of embroidered polo shirts — but it was the one I wore on the fateful day I crossed paths with my other favorite Club America player: none other than Cuauhtémoc Blanco.
It was orchestrated not by the academy but by chance, plus the universal appeal of Six Flags.
I came off my second ride of the Superman rollercoaster to find out that my friend’s chofer, who was accompanying me because none of my friends wanted to go on the rollercoaster, had seen Cuauhtémoc.
I couldn’t believe it.
Why didn’t you get his autograph? Because I know him from back in the day, I used to play soccer with him.
Where did he go?

Sure enough, there he was — standing in a crowd of parents watching their kids on one of the kiddie rides.
Some of the parents were wearing Club America jerseys, but none of them were looking at him.
I couldn’t believe nobody recognized him, but then again I barely did, in his dark sunglasses and white t-shirt advertising a splashing Aquafina water bottle.
A shrewd disguise really.
Although it also helped that he naturally looked less like a Mexican soccer star and more like a Mexican Tony Soprano.
I waited for the kiddie ride to end and, as the parents dispersed, I approached him, heart thumping.
I got straight to the point — can I have an autograph? He paused, glanced over his shoulders, took the pen my friend’s chofer had given me, found the top corner of my shirt, and signed it.
When I got back to my friends, they couldn’t believe it.

In my university years, some of my friends developed a special affinity for Four Horsemen (4H), our local casual-yet-high-end wear clothing store.
(Street wear?) The walls were all white, the clothes were expensive, the music was hip, and the employees even hipper.
I browsed often but rarely purchased anything.
And yet I spent hundreds of dollars there.
All I remember buying is a pair of New Balances 997(?) sneakers, two pairs of black Chapter pants, and a pair of roomy, pleated, grey, speckled 4H pants.

The special emphasis on pants is due to the difficulty I have buying pants that don’t smother my thighs.
In fact, it was from one of the Four Horsemen workers that I first heard thick as slang, when I was trying on the grey pants.
I bought a size up and got a tailor to shorten the waist.
After years of tapering the end of my discounted Tommy Hilfiger chino pants by folding the hem, choosing those grey pants was a departure.
Looking at the loose hems in the fitting room, I was doubtful I could pull it off.
But I took the gamble and they’ve become an enduring part of my outfits.

During a day trip to Vancouver with that same friend group, I ended up splurging on an olive-colored John Elliott Hooded Villain hoodie that recently has been difficult to wear since H&M copied the inexplicable side-zipper design that Ritchie with a T from the rap group Injury Reserve quite reasonably questioned in the outro of a song:
> I don't even know who's idea it was to put a zipper on the side
> Like what...

I wore it constantly for at least a year, most often under a retro Tommy Hilfiger jean jacket (courtesy of my dad).
I still have the hoodie in my closet.
Maybe I’ll keep the for my kids to gape at in a couple decades.
