        <div class="paragraph"><p>This is my second review of this book.
I have to say – it won me over, big time.
<!--more-->
This time I read a physical copy, and it was worth it.
The spacing and formatting of the print gives the book a mysterious aura.
You feel you’re conferring secretly with the author about a strange magic that hides in prose.
He reveals what he’s learned about teasing this elusive substance into the right configurations.
In the same words he explains to you and shows you.
Some books about writing are sterile and tedious, but this book is on the other end of the spectrum.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Some of its advice has lodged into my writing brain:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Keep the space between sentences as empty as possible…</strong>
<strong>Most sentences </strong></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-2">need no preamble</a><p> - nor postlude.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Avoid writing your sentence.</strong>
<strong>Play with it in your head.</strong>
<strong>The range of possible sentence structures narrows after every word you put down.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Don’t be afraid that you’ll forget a good sentence or a good idea.</strong>
<strong>Trust yourself.</strong>
<strong>If it is important, you’ll remember it.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lots of worthwhile ideas, many of which aim to loosen rigid rules and challenge habits taught in school.
Are transition words and sentences really necessary?
Do you trust your reader so little?
<strong>You can get anywhere from anywhere.</strong>
It also challenges conventional wisdom regarding “inspiration”, “natural” writing, and “flowing” writing.
It gives interesting writing exercises like putting sentences each on their own line to compare structure, length, and rhythm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realized on second read that the author asserts in the introduction that this book is not dogma, but a collection of starting points.
Also, my prayers were answered: the book contains a healthy share of sample prose.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Very glad I came across this book.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/several-short-sentences" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>, I’m finally doing Verlyn Klinkenborg’s writing exercise of mentally formulating sentences without writing them down.
I find myself doing it habitually, out of interest.
In the shower while I think over the week’s events.
Standing on the balcony in the quiet of morning and watching a neighbor walk their dog over snowy pavement.
One word at a time I lay out a sentence in my head, pruning clutter, swapping out imprecisions, and toying with the order of clauses.
I expect it will make me a better writer.
A lovely surprise was noticing it </p><a class='hover-link'  href="/vbook/live-in-the-moment-2">making me more present</a><div class='hover-card-container'><div class='hover-card'>

<p>As writing is selection, so is storytelling </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/restraint">like curation</a><p>.
<!--more-->
From an infinite stream of events and evergrowing crowds of people, the writer plucks out a chosen few to construct their narrative.
This is the case also at the elemental level of words and sentences.
Of all the action and detail available for depiction in a scene, the writer says very little.
Good literature distills from life the beautiful and the resonant normally diluted in a sea of mundanity.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Reading good books is practice in looking through this lens at your own life.
Practice in noticing the beauty that hides in plain sight.
Even more so if you try writing about it as well.
You need nothing but experience of living and the words in your head.
Cast your attention out into the world like a fishing line and wait until you notice something.
A tug from the subconscious.
Something stirring your curiosity.
What is it?
The sound of the breeze rustling in the leaves overhead?
The colors lit up in the sunlight?
The oddly pleasing way the shapes of things arrange themselves?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Art is a means for capturing these moments.
Take a picture, draw the scene, put it in words.
What you produce is an observation not of objective reality but of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">subjective experience</a>.
Like the jarring of a firefly, you’ve taken from the vastness a little treasure so that the magic of that moment might endure a little longer.
Something for the future, for yourself and for sharing with others.
But you’re also doing something now.
You’re enjoying being alive.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve read seven chapters so far.
Here are some thoughts and some excerpts.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Describing Kenneth O’Keefe’s arrival in a coastal Irish village to visit his friend Sebastian Bullion Dangerfield at his home, who greets O’Keefe at the door:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>It was a steep hill up to Balscaddoon.
Winding close to the houses and the neighbor’s eyes having a look.
Fog over the flat water.
And the figure hunched up the road.
On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Within the doorway, smiles, wearing white golfing shoes and tan trousers suspended with bits of wire.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>O’Keefe the visitor takes in the scenery:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Delightfully written.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Later in the book, describing Dangerfield’s tiny new home:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[You] didn’t want to walk too fast in the front door or you’d find yourself going out the back.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I purposefully went into the book blind and I’m pleasantly surprised to learn that its writing style is quite experimental.
Stream of consciousness, unquoted dialogue mashed in.
It reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson for its style and subject matter.
Lecherous, base protagonists hurtling through life incurring all manner of debts with no regard for consequence and no semblance of restraint.
But in this one we catch more glimpses of the desperation and self-loathing that plauge rabid gluttons following their excesses and that trigger further indulgence.
Here the aftermath of one of Dangerfield’s odious bursts of verbal abuse towards his wife regarding her family:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A very red face.
Guilt.
Grinding the teeth.
Soul trying to get out of the mouth, swallowing it back into the body.
Shut out the sobs.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the first sentence of the very next paragraph Dangerfield is no longer at his house but at the bar:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He ordered a bottle of stout and a Gold Label, telling the boy to bring him another stout and Gold Label.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is one of the objects of the author’s experimentation, time.
Even on the lower gear of dialogue the speed is set high with snappy back-and-forth, each speaker on a new line, speech bare but the quotation marks.
And when the author doesn’t want to dwell on certain scenes, he accelerates through them by compounding dialogue and action into dense morsels:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They had one more round of stout and she turned and smiled and said that she must be going home.
And may I take you?
That’s all right.
I insist.
It’s really not necessary.
For the joy that’s in it then.
O.K.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>They set off along Suffolk Street, into the Wicklow Street and up the Great George’s.
And over there Thomas Moore was born.
Come in and see it, a nice public house indeed.
But I must go home and wash my hair.
But just a quick one.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>In they went.
The embarrassed figures looking at them and bird whispering.
The man showed them to a booth, but Mr. Dangerfield said that they were just in for a fast one.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>O surely, sir and it’s a grand evening. ‘Tis that.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The author slows the pace the most when he puts us inside Dangerfield’s head amongst his thoughts.
Him regarding his wife:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Long limbed Marion settled in the chair.
What makes you so tall and slender.
You raise your eyelids and cross your legs with something I like and wear sexless shoes with sexiness.
And Marion I’ll say this for you, you’re not blatant.
And when we get our house in the West with Kerry cattle out on the hills sucking up the grass and I’m Dangerfield K.C., things will be fine again.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like moments of contemplation imply pause.
We linger with the protagonist’s thoughts.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It continues:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A tram pounding by the window, grinding, swaying and rattling on its tracks to Dalkey.
A comforting sound.
Maps shaking on the wall.
Ireland a country of toys.
And maybe I ought to go over to Marion on the couch.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Soon and without warning the author teleports us into the next scene:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In the bedroom, Dangerfield rubbing stockinged feet on the cold linoleum.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I see many similarities to Cormac McCarthy’s writing.
Most obvious is dialogue, written without attribution, qualification, or descriptive supplement.
Deft and witty, stripped of boilerplate and stilts.
McCarthy took it a step further by dropping the quotation marks.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another obvious similarity to McCarthy’s writing is the grammatically irreverant use of nonsentences.
Declarative phrases stating what there is.
Subject only.
McCarthy’s use of these is ample yet perhaps more restrained and refined.
Donleavy showers us with them.
Another choice that quickens the pace of his writing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A third and more subtle similitude is in the varying order that clauses appear between periods.
Sentences structured shrewdly for effect and interest.
For example, to withhold predominant details and reveal them at the end to simulate their discovery.
From the first excerpt I shared:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Two structural inversions in one sentence but most important is the second.
The green door’s position at the end of the sentence grants it importance, intrigue even.
We anticipate crossing the threshold.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Donleavy’s sentence structures are most pleasing when they eliminate commas and let his words come into direct contact.
Reproducing an excerpt I shared at the beginning:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s vivid in part because each detail blends into the next.
Instead of being given parts one at a time, we experience the image fluidly as one.
McCarthy uses this technique as well.
In his magnum opus <em>Blood Meridian</em> he conjures striking images from masterfully engineered sentences.
Here is the fourth sentence of the novel:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sentences like these are carefully configured to eliminate cruft like “there are” and even suffixes like “–ing” that weaken verbs.
McCarthy opts for a touch of ambiguity by placing “darker woods” first instead of putting it after “beyond that” and consequently doubling “that”:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>rags of snow and beyond that darker woods that harbor yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>He also rejects the “–ing” solution to the problem:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>rags of snow and beyond that darker woods harboring yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is up to the writer and their sense of style to evaluate their options.
But they have to know how to generate them in the first place.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A fourth technique that Donleavy and McCarthy (and Hemingway) employ is generous use of “and” to string together images.
A snippet of an excerpt from <em>The Ginger Man</em> shared earlier:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They had one more round of stout and she turned and smiled and said that she must be going home.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Blood Meridian</em> contains extreme examples.
Here is a single sentence near the end of chapter thirteen:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They trampled the spot with their horses until it looked much like the road again and the smoking gunlocks and sabreblades and girthrings were dragged from the ashes of the fire and carried away and buried in a separate place and the riderless horses hazed off into the desert and in the evening the wind carried the ashes and the wind blew in the night and fanned the last smoldering billets and drove forth the last fragile race of sparks fugitive as flintstrikings in the unanimous dark of the world.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>That last bit is brilliant.
Again:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[the wind] drove forth the last fragile race of sparks fugitive as flintstrikings in the unanimous dark of the world.</p></div>
</blockquote>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>This book seems to be mostly about abuse, often violent, inflicted by men against women.
<!--more-->
Its depictions are brief, detached, yet powerful.
They speak from the victims’ perspectives in a tone that evokes quiet despair, adaptive dissociation, and steely resilience.
Protagonists endure brutality and survive it at the cost of deep internal fragmentation.
There seems to be no heartening message or moral of sort, just the observation that unchecked narcissism and cruelty abound in men of our world and that the victims however scarred and burdened they may be carry on as the version of themselves that remains alive.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I suppose all of the above serves in no way as a useful recommendation.
But I should say that not all stories in this book deal with brutality and abuse, and even those that do have more things than shock and sorrow to offer.
Foremost is Scanlan’s unique yet accessible prose, which she assiduously pruned, tuned, and polished into remarkable little language contraptions.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As described in the New Yorker:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In all her books, Scanlan writes about ordinary life in extraordinary ways by compacting it radically, like pressurizing carbon into diamonds.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanlan continued this practice in novel form with <em>Kick the Latch</em>, which came out two years later in 2022.
For me, she is one of the most exciting prose writers working today.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>The premise and the set are both interesting, but for so long I’m just waiting for something to happen.
<!--more-->
I want to feel like a mystery is unfolding before me, that the answer to each of my questions raises another even more fervently in need of addressing.
But instead I feel like the writers are withholding information, stalling for time.
My intrigue wanes into restlessness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The pace jolts into high gear at the end of season one, when the writers finally show their cards.
All this time they have been sitting on highgrade, plotpromising bombshells.
And as the season finale approaches, it’s finally time to drop them.
Yes, what a thrill.
But I don’t feel so much shocked and swayed as I do manipulated.
Is this any way to tell a story?
Create a sudden climax and end it right there, with not even the beginnings of resolution?
Why didn’t the writers introduce the same ideas earlier in the season and develop them throughout?
We all know the answer already.
In the end, <em>Severance</em> is more asset than art.
It is, above all, a strategic allocation for growing Apple’s share of the streaming market.
And how do you keep people watching?
You end on a cliffhanger.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As a viewer, I feel my interest being managed and manipulated rather than being cultivated.
I don’t feel like a thrilling story is being recounted for my entertainment, I feel like I’m being sold a product.
<em>Please keep watching, we promise something interesting is coming soon.</em>
I’m sure there are people involved in making <em>Severance</em> that want to make genuinely good TV but the overall effort seems to me more like hedging than striving.
It’s ironic when you consider that Lumon’s closest analogue in the real world might in fact be Apple.
There is the cultlike adulation of a heroic founder, the snaking corporate campus enshrouded in dark glass, the obnoxious secrecy, and so on, but the most meaningful similarity is the basic one.
They are gigantic tech corporations held aloft by myths of technotopian supremacy and driven by an everincreasing hunger for growth and expansion.
(Also, Lumon sounds like Lemon.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The basics of telling a good story is like playing chess.
You can’t rely on sneak attacks or smuggled secrets.
The pieces and the tensions between them are all in plain view, brought into position one step a time.
The tensions build until there comes a natural point when the deadlock breaks and the inevitable drama ensues.
Consequences ripple and trigger further action.
There is no need to contrive plot.
It flows out of confrontation between agents in the story.
If nothing happens its because the people moving the pieces don’t know what they are doing.
Or they’re holding back.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The writers of <em>Severance</em> might well know how to write a good story.
But I think the problem is that the real chess is being played by Apple, who is mobilizing their pieces – <em>Severance</em>, <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and so on – to corner a share of the market.
Their ultimate goal is not to make compelling television, but to compel us to keep watching.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I much prefer the approach that the writers of <em>The White Lotus</em> have been taking.
Instead of hinting cryptically at forthcoming drama and withholding it for several episodes, they start with a cast of characters with tensions already between and within them.
The potential is there from the beginning.
Throughout the season they build up the existing tensions and introduce new ones until eventually someone takes action or an incident triggers a chain of reactions.
Drama and plot flow naturally from interpersonal dynamics instead of dictating them.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>Can quantifying the attributes of a TV show tell us something about its quality?
<!--more-->
I reckon some of the flaws in <em>House of the Dragon</em> would be reflected in statistics like amount of dialogue per minute and number of decisions made per character.
A non-negligible amount of time is spent on dramatic montages and orchestral music that create a moody atmosphere and remind us of how serious the situation is.
This comes at the cost of time that could be spent on actual situations and actual drama, or at least character development that would contribute to future drama.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These two elements – dialogue and decision-making – each give us an independent perspective into a character, but their combination is especially powerful because it gives us a third angle: insight into what a character is <em>thinking</em>, including what they are thinking unconsciously.
From this we get what might be the critical ingredient of great story-telling: three-dimensional characters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My qualm with shows like <em>House of the Dragon</em> is that their plot feels designed and implemented.
I sense the presence of writers and their attempts to show me what’s happening and persuade me that it makes sense.
I can’t get lost in the fictional world as if it were a real one because I see the pencil marks from when it was sketched out.
My <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a> never takes off.
One might say, Well, yeah, all fictional plots are prescribed.
But they’re not, and writers like Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy have </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/where-ideas-come-from">attested to it</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In great shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, plot is not implemented, it’s incubated.
The show feels to me like it’s happening spontaneously, developing by itself as a sequence of events, reactions, and actions.
In every episode there is constant dialogue between characters and a steady supply of situations that require characters to make decisions.
And much of the time, these have nothing to do with plot.
Every season has at least one major narrative arc, but the dependence is flipped.
Episodes don’t depend on an overarching plot for their meaning.
Episodes generate the plot.
Characters are agents, not passengers.
I don’t feel like the writers are leading me to the plot’s predetermined destination.
In fact I don’t feel their presence at all.
