I looked up life expectancy last summer.
I might live to eightytwo or so.

So, 2078 may be my last year.
We'll see.

### 2086

_January 5 2025_ –
Several weeks ago I watched a video about the Vancouver Sky Train.
It opened in 1985, just in time for [Expo 86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_86).
In 2025, the year I watched the video, the Sky Train celebrated its fourtieth anniversary.
When I realized I would likely die before the hundredth anniversary in 2085, it made me very sad.
I had to stop the video so I could cry.
It was almost like grieving my own death, but likely I was just grieving loss in general.
The loss I've already endured and the even greater loss that awaits me.
I am yet young and my future is bright but in it also are great dark clouds that each will come in their own time to smother and leave me breathless.
