Reflecting on the year.
<!--more-->

### what happened

2025 is the year I
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">fell in love with Vancouver.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">got back into golf, a game I learned and loved to play in childhood.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">predetermined most of the books I read.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">learned that certain movie theatres project actual film.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">suffered the stress of tax complications.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">stood up on a surfboard for the first time.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">learned how [Vancouver plans](https://www.shapeyourcity.ca/vancouver-plan) to develop in the next 25 years.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">visited Ireland for the first time.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">visited England for the first time.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">went to my first Arsenal game, and at the Emirates no less.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">began believing Arsenal will win the title.</li>
    <li>(will have) visited Mérida for the first time.</li>
</ul>

### what I intended

I began the year with several intentions.
<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Do big things at work.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Get fitter.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Lose twenty pounds.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Have more discussions with friends.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Read copiously.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Keep writing for and developing this site.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Nurture friendships.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Heal and grow.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Enjoy our DINK status.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Ruminate on longterm plans.</li>
</ol>

And I tried to foster incremental progress in the intentions above by reproducing them as parts of a daily goal to:
<ol type="i">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">work</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">exercise</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">read</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">write</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">enjoy</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">grow</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">discuss</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">socialize</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">plan</li>
</ol>

### how I did

I'm happy with the progress I made on #1, #4, #6, #7, and #10.
But I didn't really accomplish #2 or #3.

On #5 I did decently.
I read eight of the fourteen books I set out to read.
On top of that I read an extra four books and listened to a fifth.
Of the original fourteen I read part of two and {% vbook_post ditched | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} them.
Every now and then I read articles in the New Yorker.
I definitely feel I have a healthy reading endurance.
The "copious" part of the goal didn't come easily to me.
I read in bouts.
I don't like forcing myself to read when I'm not in {% vbook_post the mood | 2023-11-30-chart-moods %}.

I'm not sure how to evaluate my progress on #8 yet.

On #9 Z and I did the basics.
Sleep in.
Play video games.
Golf.
See our friends all the time.
Spend long, quiet weekends lounging and doing as we please.
