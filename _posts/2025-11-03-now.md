<!--more-->
In 2025 I {% vbook_post did several things | 2025-12-15-2025-retro %}.

I began the year with several intentions.
<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Do big things at work.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Get fitter.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Lose twenty pounds.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Have more discussions with friends.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Read copiously.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Keep writing for and developing this site.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Nurture friendships.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Heal and grow.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Enjoy our DINK status.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Ruminate on longterm plans.</li>
</ol>

To foster continuous, incremental progress on those intentions I translated them into daily goals: work, exercise, read, write, enjoy, grow, discuss, socialize, and plan.

I'm happy with the progress I made on #1, #4, #6, #7, and #10.
I think I may have made progress on #2, but I didn't measure it.
I didn't accomplish #3.
But at my annual medical my doctor commended me for my progress over the last two years.

On #5 I did decently.
I read eight of the fourteen books I set out to read.
On top of that I read an extra four books and listened to a fifth.
Of the original fourteen I read part of two and {% vbook_post ditched | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} them.
Every now and then I read articles in the New Yorker.
I definitely feel I have a healthy reading endurance.
The "copious" part of the goal didn't come easily to me.
I read in bouts.
I don't like forcing myself to read when I'm not in {% vbook_post the mood | 2023-11-30-chart-moods %}.

I'm not sure how to evaluate my progress on #8 yet.

On #9 Z and I did the basics.
Sleep in.
Play video games.
Golf.
See our friends all the time.
Spend long, quiet weekends lounging and doing as we please.
