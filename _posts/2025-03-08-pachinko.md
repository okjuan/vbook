I am twenty percent into the book and so far I've found the writing style relatively plain but nice to read.
<!--more-->
It's built on fundamental physical imagery like "sharp winds" and warm floors and listed descriptions of each person's appearance.
The story spans generations but the pace of each scene is slow and patient.
It gives me feelings similar to those I get reading Steinbeck's and Wendell Berry's fiction.
