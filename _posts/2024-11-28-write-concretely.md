Writing {% vbook_post _how to revise a sentence #4_ | 2024-11-28-revise-a-sentence-4 %} prompted me to finally put in words my thoughts on "concrete" writing.
<!--more-->

By "concrete" I don't mean things that are literally tangible, but things that can be grasped mentally, intuitively, beyond the abstract symbols (words) that represent it.
In other words, a word or phrase is more concrete the more it translates in a reader's mind to a distinct mental image or sensation.

The hollowness of buzzwords is related to their inablility to cause a specific mental effect.
They are duds not because the words themselves are meaningless, but because they seem to refer to nothing in particular.
Words become buzzwords when too many people use them to avoid saying something, when they wield them like a blunt object, swatting away invocations to say something of substance, something concrete.

This failure infects the words themselves.
They lose their vigor not only when present in the platitudinous speech of dishonest politicians and interested businesspeople, but when used thoughtfully by people who mean them in a particular way.
My mom for example uses the word "synergy" in a genuine, intentional way, but I am skeptical that even her optimism is enough to revitalize the word, which is arguably as lifeless as a carcass, all the meat of its meaning picked away to beef up the keynote speeches of glib business executives.
