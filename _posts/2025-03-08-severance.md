title: why is Severance so slow?

The premise and the set are both really interesting, but for so long I'm just waiting for something to happen.

I want to feel like a mystery is unfolding before me, that each answer only raises more questions.
But instead I mostly feel like the writers are withholding information, stalling for time.
My intrigue wanes into restlessness.

The pace jolts into high gear at the end of season one, when the writers finally show their cards.
All this time they have been sitting on highgrade, plotpromising bombshells so they could drop and create a thrilling finale.
But is this any way to tell a story?
Create a sudden climax and end it right there, with not even the beginnings of resolution?
Why didn't the writers introduce the same ideas earlier in the season and develop them throughout?
Well, probably because Severance is more asset than art.
It is, above all, a strategic allocation for growing Apple's share of the streaming market.

I suspect this is why I feel like my interest is managed and manipulated rather than being cultivated.
I don't feel like a thrilling story is being recounted for my entertainment, I feel like I'm being sold a product.
I'm sure there are people involved in making _Severance_ that want to make genuinely good TV but the overall effort seems to me more like hedging than striving.
It's ironic when you consider that Lumon's closest analogue in the real world might in fact be Apple.
There is the cultlike adulation of a heroic founder, the snaking corporate campus enshrouded in dark glass, the obnoxious secrecy, and so on, but the most meaningful similarity is the basic one.
They are gigantic tech corporations held aloft by myths of technotopian supremacy and driven by an everincreasing hunger for growth and expansion.
(Also, Lumon sounds like Lemon.)

Writing a good story is, in a way, like playing chess.
You can't rely on sneak attacks or smuggled secrets.
The pieces and the tensions between them are all in plain view, brought into position one step a time.
The tensions builds until there comes a natural point when the deadlock breaks and the inevitable drama breaks out.
There is no need to contrive conflict.
If nothing happens its because the players don't know what they are doing.
The writers of _Severance_ might know how to write a good story.
But I think the problem is that the real chess is being played by Apple.
Shows like _Severance_ and _Ted Lasso_ are pieces mobilized for cornering a share of the market.
