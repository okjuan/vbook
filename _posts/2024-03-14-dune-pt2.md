When I have kids I will definitely show them this movie.
<!--more-->
Stunning visuals and audio.
Really moody.
I really liked Zendaya's performance.

Was the shot of the ear crawling with bugs a nod to Lynch?
I hope so.

Definitely not perfect.
The main problem is that the story doesn't fit into the movie format.
It deserves to be a high budget TV series.
Hell, they could have done both: one compressed movie (this one) and an expanded version consisting of multiple episodes.
Movie theatres could show both.
I wonder if they've considered that.

I was also disappointed to see Stilgar flattened into a caricature.
He was funny because of it but I'm not sure the chuckles were worth underusing Javier Bardem.

I guess I should hush up and read the books.
