Suppose you have this sentence:
> It leads us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future

<!--more-->

Conventional writing wisdom would condemn it for using **leads** and **leading** in the same sentence.
But, more importantly, it doesn't sound right.

What if we prune **leading** out of the second part of the sentence?
> It leads us out of the present, into a life spent leaning into the future

Now there's a bit of tension around the comma.
You can hear a touch of awkwardness when you read it aloud to yourself.

> It leads us out of the present and into a life spent leaning into the future

Is that better?
Or is there is still something off?
If you're not sure, leave it for now and read through the draft later.
