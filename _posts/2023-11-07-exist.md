Can you trust someone who denies that their subsconsious plays a major role in their life?
<!--more-->
A good reason to deny your subsconscious is fear of what it contains.

An ego is like a mask that smooths over blemishes and hardens the sensitive spots.
It is a tool and a burden.
Some egos are so big that they become difficult to remove or distinguish from one's actual self.
If you can't unmask in private, with a loved one or by yourself, do you still exist?
Are you alive?

A big ego is like a great shield that blocks out all -- insults, criticism, connection, love, truth.
Underneath the shield is a self too fearful to exist.
A big ego houses despair and another secret: self-hatred.

Dissociating from your ego allows you to uncover your fears and your stifled self.
But before you separate from your ego, you must believe you can exist without it.
You must have courage.
And you must _want_ to exist without it.
You must want integrity.

A person who claims to have an insignificant subsconscious is either a liar or a person of great integrity.
And what are the odds that one has no internal conflicts awaiting resolution?
