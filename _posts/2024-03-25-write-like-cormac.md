The main reason I read Cormac McCarthy is to experience and learn from his writing craft.

Here is his description of two salvage divers investigating a sunken airplane at the beginning of his penultimate novel, {% post_url_with_hover_card _The Passenger_ | 2024-06-15-the-passenger %}:
> Oiler had cut away the latching mechanism and the door stood open.
> He was just inside the plane crouched against the bulkhead.
> He gestured with his head and Western pulled up in the door and Oiler shone his light down the aircraft aisle.
> The people sitting in their seats, their hair floating.
> Their mouths open, their eyes devoid of speculation.
> The workbasket was sitting on the floor inside the door and Western reached and got the other divelight and pulled himself into the plane.
>
> He kicked his way slowly down the aisle above the seats, his tanks dragging overhead.
> The faces of the dead inches away.
> Everything that could float was against the ceiling.
> Pencils, cushions, styrofoam coffeecups.
> Sheets of paper with the ink draining off into hieroglyphic smears.
> A tightening claustrophobia.
> He doubled under and got himself turned around and made his way back.

This excerpt alone contains a few hallmarks of Cormac's style.
A great trust in periods, a sparing use of commas.
Trust in the word **and** to string together a sequence of actions.

In **bulkhead** there is a hint of his preference for describing objects and parts of things with a vocabulary so precise that it often delves into the technical.

Perhaps in **workbasket** and certainly in **coffeecups** there is evidence of his distrust of dashes and all other [**weird little marks** that **blot the page up**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy#Writing_approach_and_style).

When describing a scene, he often drops the predicate from sentences that don't need it.
He simply names what is in the scene.

> Sheets of paper with the ink draining off into hieroglyphic smears.

Instead of:
> There were sheets of paper with the ink draining off into hieroglyphic smears.

Which adds needless clutter at the start of the sentence.

He could tweak the phrase to give it official Sentence status, but this comes at the cost of giving undue focus to a contrived subject:
> From sheets of paper, ink drained off into hieroglyphic smears.

Or:
> Hieroglyphic smears formed from the ink draining off sheets of paper.

Cormac bypasses the problem altogether by asserting that writing in complete sentences is not necessary.
These phrases don't need subjects, so they don't need to be sentences.
