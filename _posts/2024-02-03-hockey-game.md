I liked analyzing the game's tactics and patterns from my ignorant perspective.

The production, too.
From speakers hanging above pop music blared whenever the game paused, even if just for a few seconds.
As soon as a referee dropped the puck again, the clocked resumed and the music evaporated.
They also managed to squeeze in two performances from local country music singer, [Antonio Larosa](https://www.antoniolarosamusic.com/).
He sounded good, but no one in the stadium seemed to care much.

This was my second time at an NHL game and my main memory of the first one, back in middle school, is being baffled when it ended after _three_ periods, not two, or four.
This time, I went in knowing a bit more, including the offside rule: players on the attacking team can't cross the thick blue line into other team's third of the rink unless the puck is already there.
Watching the Canucks, I noticed that, right before crossing the blue line, attacking players would often fling the puck into the opposing end and swarm around it.
It irked me how often they did it.
I wanted them to keep dribbling.
I've since learned that they do this because the defensive team can't just dump the puck back out.
They first have to regain possession and get it back across that blue line.
Only then can they launch it into the other team's end.
Then the cycle repeats at the other end.
It's funny how [games are designed]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2024-02-03-what-are-rules %}) to avoid certain behaviors and can end up transforming the tactics of how the game is played.
