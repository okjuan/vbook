I've read seven chapters so far.
Here are some thoughts and some excerpts.
<!--more-->

Describing Kenneth O'Keefe's arrival in a coastal Irish village to visit his friend Sebastian Bullion Dangerfield at his home:
> It was a steep hill up to Balscaddoon.
> Winding close to the houses and the neighbor's eyes having a look.
> Fog over the flat water.
> And the figure hunched up the road.
> On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.
>
> Within the doorway, smiles, wearing white golfing shoes and tan trousers suspended with bits of wire.

O'Keefe the visitor takes in the scenery:
> Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.

Delightfully written.

Describing a tiny house:
> [You] didn't want to walk too fast in the front door or you'd find yourself going out the back.

I purposefully went in blind and am surprised at how experimental the book is.
Stream of consciousness, unquoted dialogue mashed in.
It reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson for its style and subject matter.
Lecherous, base protagonists hurtling through life incurring all manner of debts with no regard for consequence and no semblance of restraint.
But in this one we catch more glimpses of the desperation and self-loathing plauging the rabid gluttons following their excesses.
Here the aftermath of one of Dangerfield's odious bursts of verbal abuse towards his wife and her family:
> A very red face.
> Guilt.
> Grinding the teeth.
> Soul trying to get out of the mouth, swallowing it back into the body.
> Shut out the sobs.

In the first sentence of the very next paragraph Dangerfield is no longer at his house but at the bar:
> He ordered a bottle of stout and a Gold Label, telling the boy to bring him another stout and Gold Label.

This is one of the objects of the author's experimentation, time.
The default speed is set with snappy dialogue that skips by.
Each speaker on a new line, speech bare but the quotation marks.
And when the author doesn't want to dwell on certain scenes, he accelerates through them by compounding dialogue and action into dense morsels:
> They had one more round of stout and she turned and smiled and said that she must be going home.
> And may I take you?
> That's all right.
> I insist.
> It's really not necessary.
> For the joy that's in it then.
> O.K.
>
> They set off along Suffolk Street, into the Wicklow Street and up the Great George's.
> And over there Thomas Moore was born.
> Come in and see it, a nice public house indeed.
> But I must go home and wash my hair.
> But just a quick one.
>
> In they went.
> The embarrassed figures looking at them and bird whispering.
> The man showed them to a booth, but Mr. Dangerfield said that they were just in for a fast one.
>
> O surely, sir and it's a grand evening. 'Tis that.

The author slows the pace the most when he puts us inside Dangerfield's head amongst his thoughts.
Him regarding his wife:
> Long limbed Marion settled in the chair.
> What makes you so tall and slender.
> You raise your eyelids and cross your legs with something I like and wear sexless shoes with sexiness.
> And Marion I'll say this for you, you're not blatant.
> And when we get our house in the West with Kerry cattle out on the hills sucking up the grass and I'm Dangerfield K.C., things will be fine again.

Like moments of contemplation imply pause.
We linger with the protagonist's thoughts.

It continues:
> A tram pounding by the window, grinding, swaying and rattling on its tracks to Dalkey.
> A comforting sound.
> Maps shaking on the wall.
> Ireland a country of toys.
> And maybe I ought to go over to Marion on the couch.

Soon and without warning the author whisks us into the next scene:
> In the bedroom, Dangerfield rubbing stockinged feet on the cold linoleum.

I see many similarities to Cormac McCarthy's writing.
Most obvious is dialogue, written without attribution, qualification, or descriptive supplement.
Deft and witty, stripped of boilerplate and stilts.
McCarthy took it a step further by dropping the quotation marks.

Another obvious similarity to McCarthy's writing is the grammatically irreverant use of nonsentences.
Declarative phrases stating what there is.
Subject only.
McCarthy's use of these is ample yet perhaps more restrained and refined.
Donleavy showers us with them.
Another choice that quickens the pace of his writing.

A third and more subtle similitude is in the varying order that clauses appear between periods.
Sentences structured shrewdly for effect and interest.
For example, to withhold predominant details and reveal them at the end to simulate their discovery.
From the first excerpt I shared:
> On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.

Two structural inversions in one sentence but most important is the second.
The green door's position at the end of the sentence grants it importance, intrigue even.
We anticipate crossing the threshold.

Donleavy's sentence structures are most pleasing when they eliminate commas and let his words come into uninterrupted contact.
Reproducing an excerpt I shared near the beginning:
> Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.

The image is vivid in part because each detail blends into the next.
Instead of being given the parts that make up the picture one at a time we are given them all together assembled into the whole.
McCarthy uses this technique a lot in _Blood Meridian_ with intensity cranked all the way up.
