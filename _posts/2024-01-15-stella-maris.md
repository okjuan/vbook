I'm 65% into this book and so far it has consisted only of dialogue between two people, psychiatrist and voluntarily institutionalized patient.
Nothing else.
<!--more-->
Dialogue between these two I expect will fill the rest of the book as well.
It's an exciting endeavor to witness Cormac take on.

McCarthy published this book alongside _The Passenger_ in 2022 as a "companion novel" alternatively known as _The Passenger #2_.
I chose to try this one first though because among its topics are math and philosophy.
This one is set chronologically after _The Passenger_ but reading the two in order does not seem imperative,
this impression assembled from the fragments of scantily skimmed book summaries.
(Aside: movie trailers are even worse.
They reveal far too much.
I'd much prefer a trailer that was a short sample of the movie instead of a crude story summary undermining its telling.)

This book is clearly a product of and perhaps a tribute to the years Cormac spent at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) discussing consciousness, mathematics, physics, language, and philosophy with scientists and researchers.
Much of what the protagonist says -- about the unconscious, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, mathematics  -- Cormac himself says in conversation with SFI's David Krakauer in [this interview](https://youtu.be/HrUy1Vn2KdI?si=awtdDfdZqwE7qzfS) from 2017, which serves as good companion material to the companion novel.

After I finish this book I intend to read -- in addition to _The Passenger_ -- [A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782783.A_Dialogue_on_Personal_Identity_and_Immortality), in which a philosopher lying on his deathbed argues against the likelihood of an afterlife.
It is similar to _Stella Maris_ not only in form and subject matter but also in situation: death looms over the protagonist.

I also intend to watch Nolan's _Oppenheimer_.
