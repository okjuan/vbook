I'm 120 pages into this book and so far it has consisted purely of dialogue between a psychiatrist and a patient who has voluntarily checked herself in.
<!--more-->
Dialogue between these two I expect will fill the rest of the book.
It's an exciting endeavor to witness Cormac attempt.

He published this book alongside {% post_url_with_hover_card _The Passenger_ | 2024-06-15-the-passenger %} in 2022 as a "companion novel" known also as _The Passenger #2_.
I tried this one first though because among its topics are math and philosophy.
It is set chronologically after _The Passenger_, but my impression, assembled from fragments of scantily skimmed book summaries, is that reading them in either order is fine.

(Even more than novel summaries I avoid movie trailers.
They reveal far too much.
I'd be happy to watch them if instead of crudely summarizing the story and undermining its telling they showed a short sample of the movie.
A scene at most and no more.)

This book is clearly a product of the years Cormac spent at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) in conversation with scientists and researchers discussing consciousness, mathematics, physics, language, and philosophy.
Much of what the protagonist Alicia says -- about the unconscious, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, mathematics  -- Cormac himself says in conversation with SFI's President David Krakauer in [this interview](https://youtu.be/HrUy1Vn2KdI?si=awtdDfdZqwE7qzfS) from 2017.
The interview is good companion material to the companion novel.

This book reminds me of another, which I intend to return to when I finish this one: [A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782783.A_Dialogue_on_Personal_Identity_and_Immortality), in which a philosopher lying on her deathbed argues with her friend against the likelihood of an afterlife.
In _Stella Maris_ death also looms -- not just over the protagonist but also its author.
Cormac died six months after this final publication.
