Here is the progression of a sentence {% vbook_post I wrote today | 2025-01-18-my-2025 %} from first draft to final form.
<!--more-->
These iterative versions don't capture all the edits I attempted, they are snapshots taken along the evolution of the sentence.

Seeing how it grew in length reminds me of Verlyn Klinkenborg's claim that long sentences are just {% vbook_post several short sentences | 2023-02-25-several-short-sentences %} put together and that write a long sentence we must begin by learning how to write a short one.
In fact by the end I finish with two, one long one shorter.

I notice that new images and phrasings spring up between drafts.
**The PNW** turns into **coast cities of the PNW**.
**Encroach** appears and then does the **gray blanket**.
And the explicit name of **joy** disappears so that its feeling may be {% vbook_post conveyed rather than stated | 2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing %}.
