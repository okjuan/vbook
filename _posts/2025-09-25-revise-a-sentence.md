Here is the progression of a sentence {% vbook_post I wrote today | 2025-01-18-my-2025 %} from first draft to final form.
<!--more-->
These iterative versions don't capture all the edits I attempted, they are snapshots taken along the evolution of the sentence.

Seeing how it grew in length reminds me of Verlyn Klinkenborg's claim that long sentences are just {% vbook_post several short sentences | 2023-02-25-several-short-sentences %} put together and that to write a long sentence one must know how to write a short one.
In fact by the end I finish with two sentences, one long one shorter.

I began with this attempt:

> The sunshine and cool air of September in the PNW brings me joy.

Ending with **brings me joy** felt weak.
Not sure why.
Maybe because it is preceded by a much larger subject?
(When I showed Z this discussion later on, she pointed out **brings me joy** is a bit cliche. I think she's right. It's trite, trendy phrasing. A "volunteer phrase," to use Verlyn Klinkenborg terminology.)
So I tried moving **joy** to the beginning of the sentence and giving it a more central role as the active verb **rejoice**:

> I rejoice in the sunshine and cool air of September in the coastal cities of the PNW.

But I dislike long dependent clauses like **of September in the coastal cities of the PNW**.
Maybe because they plod on boringly?
Or because they give the reader a bunch of contextual facts to apply rationally and retroactively?
Better to set the scene by cruising into it:

> In the coastal cities of the PNW September maintains the summer sunshine as it

I didn't even finish that attempt.
Another impulse, one to put September at the forefront, hijacked control:

> In September the coastal cities of the PNW maintain summerlike sunshine

Again I aborted and retraced similar steps with a few additions:

> In September along the coast of the PNW summerlike sunshine remains a while as the air cools but before sunsets encroach on the afternoons

**Along** is a nice addition and **remains a while** is a nice substitute for **maintain**.
These two along with the phrase **as the air cools** contribute to a pleasant sense of temporal and spatial continuity.
Our view of the coast is panning instead of static and the air is not just cool but in the process of cooling.
The sunshine is lingering.

I was also pleased with the image of **sunsets encroach**ing.
It expresses that their approach is unwelcome.

Worth noting that **joy** and **rejoice** have disappeared.
At this point I am working on conveying the feeling {% vbook_post instead of naming it | 2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing %}.

> In September, before sunsets encroach on the afternoons, along the coast of the PNW summerlike sunshine remains a while as the air cools but

In this one I begin the separation of before and after.

> Before October, when the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the last of the summer sunshine peters out, we have September here in the coastal PNW

Here I solidify the before and after.
Or I suppose the after and before.

> Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the last of the summer sunshine peters out, we have the cooling air and warm sunshine of September.

Setting regains its footing at the front.
It applies cleanly to the two pieces that followg, the after and before.

At this point I realize that **the last of the summer sunshine** and **warm sunshine** are repeating the same idea and undermining the juxtaposition of the after and before.
They're both sunny?
Sounds like October is pretty similar to October then, apart from the earlier sunsets.

> Here in the coastal cities of the PNW before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the sky, we have September.
> It is a brief period of balance, of cool air and warm sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.

Ah!
Attention to the tension of redundant **sunshine** has yielded a lovely new image!
And one that completes the intended contrast between October and September.
Very nice.

I also split off the description of September's weather and atmosphere into a separate sentence so that September can have its dramatic entrance.
**We have September.**
Woah, what's up with September?
Not much I would've thought, but apparently it's the last bastion before a dreary autumn.
The momentum of that question provoked carries us into the next sentence, where its answer lies.

At this point I feel I have found my sentence's form.
Now to make little improvements:

> Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets encroach on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the sky, we have September.
> A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.

I add the commas back in to slow things down and build up more dramatically to September's entrance.
I also prune **warm** because **sunshine** is already warm and because doing so balances **sunshine** with **cool air**.
Two syllables each.
But, more importantly, it _feels_ balanced, which is what the sentence is all about.
The seemingly contradictory description of **soft crunchy** serves the same purpose.

> Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets begin encroaching on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the daytime sky, we have September.
> A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.

Another couple tweaks.
Spreading **sunsets encroach** into **sunsets begin encroaching** enhances the feeling of continuity and motion we discussed before.
Adding **daytime** to **sky** sharpens the reference to the lost sunshine.

A long way way from where we started:

> The sunshine and cool air of September in the PNW brings me joy.
