### Life

Preparing green card papers for my wife, Z.
We probably won't get them until early 2025.
_Sigh_.

Enjoying the fall.
Except for the short days.
Sun sets at 4:30pm nowadays.
Blehj.

Playing soccer.
I've noticed in the last several months that I'm scoring more goals from longer range, 20+ yards away from goal.
I'm delighted that it's turning out to be one of my strengths in the game.
I'd gotten used to thinking that headers and penalties were my only goal-scoring strengths.
(And, actually, I've gotten worse at penalties in the last several years.)
I think I'm reaping the benefits of the hours I spent in my late teens (and perhaps early twenties) practicing long-range shooting.

Losing weight.
I've lost ~11lbs in the last 5 months, an average of 2.2lbs per month.
If I can keep up that rate, I'll reach my goal weight of 189lbs in 13.6 months.
Geez, that's January 20_25_.
Sounds like early 2025 will be cathartic time for me.

I've noticed my attitude towards money has shifted recently.
For years, I've wanted to keep open the option of taking a major career risk, so I wanted to save as much as possible.
But nowadays, I'm pretty happy and could see myself staying at Microsoft for a few more years, at least.
I am fortunate that money is not a scarce resource for me and I can use it to save time and make my life better.
I still try not to overspend, but I don't let it dominate my decisions as much anymore.

### Work

Software engineering for Microsoft Loop.
We just went to General Availability!

### Travel

Went to Mexico with Z:
Ixtapa, Mexico City, Queretaro, and San Miguel de Allende.

### Coding

Mainly working on this site, [okjuan.me/vbook]({{site.baseurl}}/).
It's been tricky because I don't know any Ruby and don't want to invest time into learning it right now.
So far, I've gotten by on documentation and other people's examples.
Most recently, I added backlinks, with some [help from Daniel Miller](https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/).
I also made tags the main way to navigate the site by folding 'categories' into them.
Not only is this cleaner and more uniform, but it also allows me to assign multiple categories (now tags) to the same post.
For example, a post can now be 'filed' under both [#essays]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/essays/) and [#journal]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/journal/).
See [Folders kill creativity](https://www.mentalnodes.com/folders-kill-creativity).

I still really want to make and deploy a front-end for [music-lib-bot](https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot).
A web app would make sense, but I also like the idea of an SMS interface or something of the like.
Maybe even something integrated into Google Assistant.

### Writing

Focused on posting here, [okjuan.me/vbook]({{site.baseurl}}/).
Not working on anything for [okjuan.medium.com](https://okjuan.medium.com/) or [okjuan.substack.com](https://okjuan.substack.com/), although I can [cross-post](https://okjuan.substack.com/p/learning-to-dress) like I did for [learning to dress]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2022-09-09-learning-to-dress %}).
Nothing currently in the works for [206 Zulu](https://www.206zulu.org/author/juan-carlos-gallegos/) either.
I worked on a second piece for them earlier this year, but that stalled.
Ended up posting it [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-03-02-first-thursday-at-metier-brewing %}).

### Reading

I just finished 2 books: [The Courage to be Disliked](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked) by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga and [Into the Abyss: A Neuropsychiatrist's Notes on Troubled Minds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52386552-into-the-abyss) by Anthony David.
_The Courage_ was thought-provoking and written in a novel form.
See Derek Sivers' [notes](https://sive.rs/book/Disliked) on it.
_Into the Abyss_ was full of fascinating cases and some good insight.

Recently read Anthony Lane's hilarious New Yorker article, [Can Happiness Be Taught?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review)
It's a review of recent best-seller [Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137978862-build-the-life-you-want), written by a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School and sponsored by Oprah Winfrey.
One of my favorite bits:

> ...imperative reigns supreme. ‚ÄúStart by working on your toughness.‚Äù No sweat. ‚ÄúTake your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.‚Äù Check. ‚ÄúRebel against your shame.‚Äù Done. ‚ÄúWiden your conflict-resolution repertoire.‚Äù Ka-pow! ‚ÄúTreat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.‚Äù Which President? ‚ÄúJournal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.‚Äù Since when did ‚Äújournal‚Äù turn into a transitive verb? ‚ÄúDig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.‚Äù Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, ‚ÄúRemember: You are your own CEO.‚Äù Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year‚Äôs migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?

Last month, I read the first part of Jane Jacobs' famous [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities).
To my surprise, it's great so far.
I expected it to be much drier, as I'm sure many books about city and neighborhood planning are.
I bought a copy and intend to read it over the next couple months.

While traveling in Mexico, I read a bit of [Vital Little Plans: The Short Works of Jane Jacobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358301-vital-little-plans).
It was really good, too.
Not sure if I'll be able to continue though.

Last month I started listening to Stephen King's [On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing) and was surprised at how entertaining it was.
I might keep listening.
I like reading [books and]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2021-12-19-daring-my-passages %}) [memoirs]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-01-16-wounds-of-passion %}) [about]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-04-05-draft-4 %}) [writing]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-02-25-several-short-sentences %}).

Last month (whew!) I also read a bit of Gloria Steinem's [Revolution from Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within), which I found on one of my dutiful visits to my local Goodwill.
It's pretty interesting.
The story about the Royal Knights of East Harlem was really moving.

I plan to listen to another chunk of [Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive) to get some health tips.
See Derek Sivers' [notes](https://sive.rs/book/Outlive) on it.

Flirting with starting [Infinite Jest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest).
I don't have a very good reason to do so, though.
So we'll see.

### TV

The Sopranos for the second time.
Amazed at the writing, once again.
They follow so many characters and develop so many dynamics at the same time.
Many story lines don't build to a climax and exist instead to develop characters and prepare future story lines.
Some just exist because they're true to life.
Like when Carmela and Tony struggle to keep their rebellious daughter in check.

Couples Therapy, season 3.
So insightful and fascinating.
Orna is an amazing therapist.

Welcome to Wrexham, season 2.
I don't think any other show has made me cry as much as this one, and I don't think it's because I love soccer so much.
The show has so much heart.

### Movies

Rewatched Roma and Coco with my wife, who hadn't seen either, while we were in Mexico.
I love doing activities that thematically or topically match other things I'm doing in life.

### What's next?

File my wife's green card papers.

Keep reading, keep writing.
Holidays are great for this.
Or so I always think.

Keep improving the design of this website.
Allow people to subscribe via RSS and email.
Add 'last updated' timestamp per post.
Tweak padding in title-subtitle-date-tags section of posts.

Keep losing weight.
Not so great for this, holidays.
Or so people say.

Holidays in Victoria.
Time with family and friends.
