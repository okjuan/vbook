{% post_url_with_hover_card The Elephant Man | 2024-01-18-elephant-man %} bears Lynch's touch lightly but this movie has his fingerprints all over.
<!--more-->
He has a gift for making scenes not only look but _feel_ surreal.
Sometimes dreamy, often nightmarish.

The movie is beautifully shot.
The shot of the old man sitting outside the gas station as Lula (Laura Dern) and Sailor (Nicholas Cage) pull away.
The mirrored shot of Lula looking at Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) standing in the doorway of the bathroom.
The color and composition of the scenes where the meddling mother, Marietta Fortune (Dianne Ladd), agonizes over Lula's relationship with Sailor.

Good acting all around, but Dafoe's and Ladd's performances were my favorite.
The scene where Marietta paints her whole face in lipstick is amazing.

The scenes where Lula is assaulted are disturbing, though they are not the most graphic in the film.
In his biography-memoir _Room to Dream_, Lynch tells the story of having to remove a very gruesome moment from the original cut of the film following more than one "mass exodus" during test screenings, including one when the test audience had been otherwise on the edge of their seats.

Another aspect of Lynch's work that some will find offputting is its disregard for reality.
Scenes move at a surprisingly slow pace.
Dialogue can feel stilted.
Characters pose in unnatural positions.
These oddities are not a result of incompetence, they're deliberate choices.
Early in the movie, Sailor interrupts a metal band midsong to confront a guy coming onto Lula, and, after he overpowers him and forces an apology, he accepts the microphone from the band's singer and starts crooning like Elvis.
The band backs him wth flawless vocal harmonies.

Lynch doesn't try to depict reality with his movies.
He'll use cars from the 50s, outfits from the 80s, and hairstyles from the 90s at same time if he wants to.
What matters is that he captures the right mood, the right feel, and that he stays true to the ideas that {% post_url_with_hover_card come to him | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %}.
