My second attempt to review a book while I read it instead of waiting until I finish it.

This book's average Goodreads rating is 4.33, which is high.
But 40 ratings (which amount to less than 1% of the total) gave it only one star out of five.
Many of these folks complain that Lanegan portrays himself as an ultimate macho man, beating betas on his way to seducing any woman he pleases.
To me this seems like a crude interpretation of Lanegan's tone.
I suppose these readers didn't stick around until the end of chapter seven, where Lanegan gets explicit about his patheticness:

> My only way to deal with what I deemed an attack (and I might deem anything an attack in those days) was to attack more aggressively in return. The level of hostility in my offensive depended on my level of fear. Fear of being caught, fear of having to tell the truth, fear of being exposed as the lying, cheating fraud I was. But it was the fear of showing my true heart, at times either so full it might burst or so empty I could cry, that hounded me most viciously.
>
> There had been a perpetual war between myself and the costume of persona I'd donned as a youngster and then worn my entire life. Petrified that someone might discover who I really was: merely a child inside the body of an adult. A boy playacting as a man. My lifelong hard-ass exterior and, underneath that, ironclad interior were all an intricately constructed, carefully cultivated, and fiercely guarded sham. I was, in reality, driven by what I'd heard referred to in rehab all those years ago as "a thousand forms of fear." Sadly, somewhere deep in my soul, I knew that was probably me.
