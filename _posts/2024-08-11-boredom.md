Out of boredom have sprung many of my projects and hobbies.

Over the years, patches of evening downtime have served as fertile ground for budding interests like playing chess, playing guitar, singing, beatmaking, programming, and writing.
A crucial factor here is lack, space for something to grow.
(That, for example, would have been a good point for {% post_url_with_hover_card Michael Harris | 2024-08-11-end-of-absence %} to make when discussing the ills of digital distraction).

Writing is one of these projects that erupted out of the seemingly lifeless terrain of boredom.
I would be farther behind in my writing output if I hadn't been so bored with my first full-time software engineering job.
Instead, I found in writing a channel of expression for my energy and ambition for craftsmanship.
Years later, if I wasn't stranded in an unfamiliar and uninteresting city while visiting my girlfriend, I wouldn't have made [my website](https://okjuan.me/) or, more importantly, [this site](https://okjuan.me/vbook/).
My main programming projects -- [Muze Radio](https://github.com/okjuan/muze-radio), [Music Lib Bot](https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot), and [Song Scrounger](https://github.com/okjuan/song-scrounger) -- owe their existence to periods of restlessness.
