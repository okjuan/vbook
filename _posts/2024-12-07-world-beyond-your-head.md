I heartily agree with Crawford's emphasis on the importance of embodied experiences and his warning that virtual worlds can promote passivity, technology as magic, and false agency.

_However_.
I am also very enthusiastic about technological tools as real tools and virtual worlds as deeply enriching.
Consider books for example.
They are a virtual, symbolic world of their own and were object of {% vbook_post moral panic | 2024-08-11-end-of-absence %} in their own time.
But I think most of us would consider them indispensable now.
Books are fictions divorced from physicality, but is that inherently bad?
I don't think so.

I am several chapters in but already think Crawford's argument needs work.
His critique of "representations" and "abstractions" needs a lot more development in my opinion.
I'd invoke him to reflect on his own life to rebalance his argument: he loves to ride motorcycles and fix them up, but he also loves to read books and write them.
Surely he needs to make space for symbolic experiences alongside physical ones?
I say this despite agreeing with his insight on the surprising hollowness of Choice as Freedom and the way resource-extractive corporations exploit this to harvest wealth from consumers.

All in all I think he makes some fantastic, nuanced points but builds a shaky overarching argument from it.
I would love to him to take a second crack at it.

As I've said {% vbook_post else| 2025-01-11-now %}{% vbook_post where | 2025-01-12-2024-in-review %}, I really appreciated that this book resisted taking the reactionary stance against technology as inherently insidious and unavoidably corruptive of our psychological wellbeing.
In the epilogue, Crawford summarizes his alternative critique of technology's role in leeching on our attention:

> The problem...of distraction...is usually discussed as a problem of technology. I [suggest] we view the problem as more fundamentally one of political economy. In a culture saturated with technologies for appropriating our attention, our interior mental lives are laid bare as a resource to be harvested by others. Viewing it this way shifts our gaze from the technology itself to the intention that guides its design and its dissemination into every area of life.

This perspective excites me not just because it rings truer but also because it prevents indiscriminate rejection of technology and instead makes possible a judicious trust that allows us to make good use of it.
