I heartily agree with Crawford's emphasis on the importance of embodied (3D) experiences and his warning that virtual worlds can promote passivity, technology as magic, and false agency.

_However_.
I am also very enthusiastic about technological tools as real tools and virtual worlds as deeply enriching.
Consider books for example.
They are a virtual, symbolic world of their own and were object of {% vbook_post moral panic | 2024-08-11-end-of-absence %} in their own time.
But I think most of us would consider them indispensable now.
Books are fictions divorced from physicality, but is that inherently bad?
I don't think so.

I am several chapters in but already think Crawford's argument needs work.
His critique of "representations" and "abstractions" needs a lot more development in my opinion.
I'd invoke him to reflect on his own life to rebalance his argument: he loves to ride motorcycles and fix them up, but he also loves to read books and write them.
Surely he needs to make space for symbolic experiences alongside physical ones?
I say this despite agreeing with his insight on the surprising hollowness of Choice as Freedom and the way resource-extractive corporations exploit this to harvest wealth from consumers.

All in all I think he makes some fantastic, nuanced points but builds a shaky overarching argument from it.
I would love to him to take a second crack at it.
