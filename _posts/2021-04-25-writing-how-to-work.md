Notes about style and process of writing [how to work]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2021-04-25-work %}).

I wrote this piece while reading Steinbeckâ€™s East of Eden.
I experimented with writing very short sentences and leaving out commas.
I like the feel of this style.
It moves quickly and is easily digestible.
