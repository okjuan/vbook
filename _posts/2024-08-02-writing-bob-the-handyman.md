I had this encounter in October of 2022, almost two years ago.

Immediately after Bob left my apartment, I snatched a pen and notebook to take down as much as I could remember verbatim before it slipped out of my mind.
I had no particular vision for what I would write, but I was sure Bob's personality was worth capturing.

At the time I'd already spent over a year reading pieces of [New Journalism](https://okjuan.me/vbook/tags/new-journalism/) and imagined I could take inspiration from a piece like Lillian Ross's [portrait of Hemingway](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1950/05/13/how-do-you-like-it-now-gentlemen), which was a magazine article so successful that it was printed on its own [as a book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42685.Portrait_of_Hemingway).

As I sit down on my couch in the blazing August sun, I still don't know how I'm going to write this.
As I begin, I realize I am already sticking to a certain tense and point of view.
Let me instead write down the sequence of events with bits of detail I remember, and later I'll fit it into a form.
