As I walk through cities nowadays I try to look through a [Jane Jacobian](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities) lens at the diversity of enterprise and use about.

By _use_, Jacobs literally means the uses buildings provide: living, working, commerce, diversion, to name some of the main ones.
_Mixed-use_ buildings refer to the mixing of more than one use.
Nowadays it's easy to take for granted mixed-use buildings, but they exist because the city planning orthodoxy of today -- which Jacobs influenced through her writing and her activism -- makes space for them.

On a recent walk I noticed a gym offering _luxury fight goods and apparel_, in the middle of a short block also housing a plant shop, a laundry service business, a kitchen renovation business, a small counterservice cafe offering "Italian street food", a nail studio, a print shop, a beauty salon, a travel agency, an importer's office, a Vietnamese restaurant, and a hip diner.
Most of these on the ground level of a three-storey residential building occupying much of the block.
On the corner past the diner there's a vacant lot recently bulldozed in preparation for a four-storey mixed-use residential building.

At their best, cities bring together people in quantities so great that critical mass can be reached for projects and enterprises that can't survive in sparser and less diverse communities.
Near Z's place in Vancouver, within a block of one of the liveliest streets in the city, there is a building that houses a gallery, a secondhand clothing shop, a shop for local art, and a coworking space.
They appear to be run by the [same collective](https://www.slicevancouver.ca/), which hosts stand up comedy nights, workshops, and other events in the gallery and coworking spaces.
I'm both delighted and surprised that they have sustained for a couple years already.

However, according to Jacobs, population density is only one of the necessary ingredients for lively and diverse city life.
I highly recommend to anyone who loves cities and would like to understand them better to read [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities).
