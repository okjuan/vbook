New York, Tofino, patio furniture, reading, writing, and more.

### interior design

An odd perk of splitting my time between Seattle and Vancouver has been furnishing and decorating a second apartment, a task for which I have enough gusto to do twice over.
More than twice, actually.
I've starting telling friends that I would gladly help them lay out their spaces.
I told one friend in particular, who finds furnishing and decorating stultifying, that when he buys his house, I will invite myself over and personally hang the artwork and mirror that have been leaning against his apartment walls for years.
I routinely watch [Never Too Small](https://www.youtube.com/c/nevertoosmall) and [Noah Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/@noahdaniel.studio) and have been toying with the idea of making TikToks or Instagram reels about my amateur interest in interior design.
I already have the topic for the initial video: how to get cheap artwork that you love.

### lounging on the balcony

Among the finest decisions I've made recently is buying patio furniture for our balcony.
I bought it secondhand for $420 USD ($575 CAD), delivery included, and within a week have spent many more minutes (in either currency) lounging, reading, writing, and working on it.
I expect to recoup a good deal of the principal when we resell in a year or two.

By furnishing the balcony we've added to our apartment a whole new space to be in.
It's like a tree house, perched up among a variety of leafy growth.
Beyond the branches, in the evenings, lays the orange pink sunset silhouetting cranes on the port and past them the city skyline.
It reminds me of this bit from Gail Sheehy's memoir:

> I had found a rent-stabilized apartment on Fifth Avenue, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art... It had a terrace overlooking Central Park. A small glass cubicle sat on one end of the terrace, where I wrote as if suspended in the sky. I could watch the leaves turn from scarlet to lemony pale and sit snug in a winter storm like being enclosed in a snow globe. It was as close to a writer's heaven as one could get.
>
>  Unheated, the cubicle was also ideally suited to keeping the neurons jumping. In winter I typed in a hoodie, my feet encased in Alaskan mukluks. In spring, the terrace became my first garden. I filled the window boxes with swaying tulips. Tubs held bonsai mimosa trees and dwarf crabapple trees that bore fruit in the fall. It was a magical place to invite friends for drinks and outdoor supper.

My alcove is more modest, but magical still.
A private little post embedded in the city.
A perfect place to read and write.

### reading

I have a knack for picking up new books even while I have already a few on the go.
Eschewing reading etiquette in this way amuses me as if it were actual mischief.
It also does a lot to maintain and continually rekindle my reading appetite.
My main book is _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, which I've been reading since last fall.
I'm about 75% done, but taking my time, letting the ideas marinate and noticing {% post_url_with_hover_card how they apply | 2024-04-07-walk %} nowadays.

With Libby and Spotify, it's easy to try out audiobooks, which are great for listening while doing activities with low mental demand like driving, cooking, and cleaning.
Recently I sampled [_Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest), because it is about a topic I'm {% post_url_with_hover_card very interested | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %} in and was recommended in a [blog post](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours) by Oliver Burkeman, who I admire for his book {% post_url_with_hover_card _Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals_ | 2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks %}.
_Rest_ was underwhelming and speculative, but thought-provoking.
I {% post_url_with_hover_card ditched | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} it, but it touched on the concept of the [Default Mode Network](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Default_mode_network), which has been, rather aptly, turning over in the back of my mind.
It was gratifying and intriguing to find a neuoscientific name for a phenomenon that I and many others have intuited.
In fact, I can tell that I am about to fall asleep when I am lying in bed and notice that my imagination has taken a life of its own, and that my conscious mind has left the director's chair for a seat in the audience.

On the other side of the spectrum of ditchability are David Graeber's books about [debt](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years) and [bureaucracy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Utopia_of_Rules:_On_Technology,_Stupidity,_and_the_Secret_Joys_of_Bureaucracy), which I've been listening to on Spotify and am thrilled to have discovered.
I only learned of Graeber last year and my expectations were low when I began listening to his book about [_Bullshit Jobs_](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bullshit_Jobs), but recently I've started thinking he may have been one of the most interesting intellectuals of recent times.
I want to get physical copies of his books and re-read them studiously, delving into topics he covers to test his judgment and theories, which I find insightful and very intriguing, if at times radical.

Otherwise, I've been picking up books on topics that relate with things going on in my life and in my head.
Having recently returned from a {% post_url_with_hover_card trip to nyc | 2024-05-26-nyc-trip %}, I finally cracked open my copy of [_Destinations_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations) to read Jan Morris's lovely piece about Manhattan.
Also, I resumed Gloria Steinem's [_Revolution From Within_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within), since I've been thinking a lot about self-esteem and ego.
Steinem's reference to Alice Miller's [_The Drama of the Gifted Child_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4887.The_Drama_of_the_Gifted_Child) sent me on a reading tangent about Miller's initial advocacy for Konrad Stettbacher's version of [primal therapy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Primal_therapy) and her eventual [denouncement](https://www.primals.org/articles/amiller.html).
Out of curiosity, I searched for New Yorker articles mentioning Alice Miller and ended up reading [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/drawn-from-life) about Bechdel, whom I only knew in relation to the [Bechdel test](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bechdel_test).

I also started reading [_remembered rapture_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51409.remembered_rapture), bell hooks's essays on writing, which is a topic I think about constantly.
This in turn led me to Zora Neale Hurston's [_Their Eyes Were Watching God_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37415.Their_Eyes_Were_Watching_God), which bell hooks cites as one of the literary treasures recovered from obscurity by second wave feminism.
In fact, according to Wikipedia, new interest in Hurston's work was sparked in 1975 by an article published in _Ms._, Gloria Steinem's magazine!

Reading {% post_url_with_hover_card like this | 2023-01-28-choose-your-next-book %} is so much fun and, for me, a much more {% post_url_with_hover_card efficient | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} use of my reading appetite.

### thinking about ego and masculinity

Alfred Adler claimed that all problems were interpersonal relationship problems.
Freudian psychoanalysts credit childhood trauma and unconscious drives as fundamental.
Lately I've been thinking about ego and self-image as a gravitational center that grounds our thoughts and behavior.
(Ego is an overloaded term and I've written about {% post_url_with_hover_card my sense | 2023-11-21-ego %} of it.)

I think that the ongoing [male crisis](https://youtu.be/GHkhTIEe254?si=qWMV2Zo8Z6qIQqet) can be articulated in terms of ego and self-esteem.
I suspect the rage many men feel is {% post_url_with_hover_card self-loathing reflected outward | 2023-11-07-exist %} in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.
These people are struggling for viable [ways to exist](https://youtu.be/DHHqQDKzjTg?si=q_rw9w_xv8P4joQC).

When I first learned of Andrew Tate's popularity with boys and young men, I was not only dismayed but surprised.
Don't we know better already?
But misogyny is not simply a problem of ignorance.
It and other expressions of violence are tools for acting out feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.
To get rid of these kinds of abhorrent behavior, we have to address the source of the problem.

Instead of offering gender-agnostic advice for self-actualization, [Christine Emba](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/), like psychotherapist [Stephen A. Shapiro](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stephen_A._Shapiro) in the past, is trying to champion positive, overtly masculine roles:
> In my ideal, the mainstream could embrace a model that acknowledges male particularity and difference but doesn’t denigrate women to do so. It’s a vision of gender that’s not androgynous but still equal, and relies on character, not just biology. And it acknowledges that certain themes — protector, provider, even procreator — still resonate with many men and should be worked with, not against.

I wonder whether this is an ideal towards which we should strive or whether it is merely a stepping stone aiming to stabilize male self-esteem as it approaches an ultimate destination.
No matter where we are on this journey, it needs to be somewhere where the male ego doesn't feel in danger.
Because, if it does, men will return again and again to the familiar coping strategy of domination, which assuages their fear of the deepest inferiority: worthlessness.

### writing

Most of what I've {% post_url_with_hover_card written | 2024-06-04-blue-note %} {% post_url_with_hover_card recently | 2024-06-01-bushwick %} has to do with New York, but I also finally wrote a review of {% post_url_with_hover_card The Passenger | 2024-06-15-the-passenger %}, the first of Cormac McCarthy's last {% post_url_with_hover_card two | 2024-01-15-stella-maris %} novels.
I also wrote a {% post_url_with_hover_card fourth entry | 2024-07-03-coordinate-metaphors-4 %} in my series of _how to coordinate metaphors_.

### traveling

Z and I went to Tofino with my family for a week to celebrate my mom's birthday.
We spent time together, ate great meals, surfed on beautiful beaches, hung out at a wonderful airbnb near the heart of town, spent a day in an [outdoor spa in a private cove](https://www.moonjellyspa.ca/) lounging in hot tubs filled with seaweed, and even [saw the Northern Lights](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/May_2024_solar_storms).
Z and I want to go back.

A week later, Z and I went to {% post_url_with_hover_card NYC | 2024-05-26-nyc-trip %} to affirm our suspicion that we would like to live there before we have kids.
I have a bad habit of winging trips, but in the month leading up to this one I dedicated good hours to research and planning.
The time spent was well worth it, rendering some of the most memorable experiences of the trip: Comedy Cellar, Village Vanguard, {% post_url_with_hover_card Blue Note | 2024-06-04-blue-note %}, Whitney Museum (for free), Tiny Cupboard Comedy Club, Roberta's, and SEY coffee.
Some of these I booked in advance, and the others I was aware of and pounced on when the opportunity arose.

We recently also spent a weekend with friends at an airbnb in Lake Cowichan.
The weather was a bit disappointing, but we had a great time hanging out in and around the hot tub.

### working

I've delivered some good results at work recently.
My tasks continue to be interesting and plenty.
However, it looks like my next promotion, which I was expecting in September, won't happen until December.
I'm disappointed, but when I reflect on it carefully, I notice it's not that important.
By no means do I _need_ to be promoted.
It's alluring because it's a quantifiable and salient achievement.
But it's not important one.

### coding

Spotify again rejected my request for an extended quota.
I emailed them back asking to speak to a real person.
No response.
It looks like it's going to be difficult to make [my app](https://okjuan.me/muze-radio/) available to all Spotify premium users, unfortunately.
That project will sit on the backburner for a while.

As for my other recent programming project -- this site -- I have some interesting new ideas.
To encourage myself to {% post_url_with_hover_card revise and rework posted pieces | 2024-04-25-what-2 %}, I want to re-order posts by their most recently edited date rather than their original publish date.
That way, I could breathe new life into old ideas that I failed to do justice on initial attempt and baptize them again as new pieces.
This aligns with the **dynamic** aspect of my {% post_url_with_hover_card virtual book | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %} idea.
A related idea I have for this site is to let (hypothetical) readers see past versions of each post, in the spirit of what I wrote in my essay {% post_url_with_hover_card The Virtual Book | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %} last year:

> What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
> ...
> What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
> What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?

One of my core interests, and one of the core passions behind this site, is the process of writing.
Interfaces that illuminate and accentuate that process intrigue me.

### watching TV

**Peep Show**.
Second watch.
So funny.

**Curb Your Enthusiasm**.
Hilarious.
Like **Peep Show**, soothing with its insanity.

**Baby Reindeer**, which was haunting, disturbing, and fantastic.

**Welcome to Wrexham**.
S3 is less ambitious, but still good.

**House of the Dragon**.
Good not great.
Rewatched S1 in preparation for S2, which is currently airing.

**Fantasmas**.
Unsettling in a very effective way, like a hyper-pop Black Mirror.
Wonderfully weird and delightfully non-linear.
By now I know I am a sucker for tangential and episodic storytelling.

### watching movies

**Dream Scenario**.
Unsettling.
I kept oscillating between sympathy and disgust for the main character, an intended effect, I think.
However, ultimately, it didn't seem to have a cogent point to make.
Or maybe I missed it.

**Challengers**.
Very entertaining.
I loved the toxic triangle between the three main characters: one chooses to be dominated, one needs to dominate, and one dominates himself to preclude others doing it.
The codependence and power dynamics rang true until they fell a bit flat towards the end.

**Radical Wolfe**, documentary about writer Tom Wolfe (and former colleague of Gloria Steinem at _New York_ magazine).
Somewhat entertaining but suspiciously uncritical, as biopics and posthumous documentary tributes tend to be.

### what's next?

Enjoying the rare and splendid sunny days of PNW summer.
Biking, paddleboarding, playing soccer, volleyball with friends.

I'm curious about playing goalkeeper for a new team.
I've been an outfield player exclusively for years, but I used to play goalie part-time and fill in when needed.
I miss it a bit.
And goalies are always in demand, so it should be an easy way to get more playing time.
Hopefully I'm not overestimating my skills in net.
I think I'll find out soon.

Cap Hill Block Party.
Excited about seeing Chappell Roan, who is apparently great to see live.

Visit PEI, before Z's mom and stepdad sell the house they have on the beach there.
