The audiobook narrated by Herbie is great.
His impression of Miles is hilarious.

It's not a beautifully written memoir like Patti Smith's _Just Kids_ or Tara Westover's [_Educated_]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2020-04-26-educated %}), but it's a worthy story.
It's fascinating to see how Herbie's collaborations pushed his career forward and how he [reinvented himself]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2022-06-11-reinvent-yourself %}) over and over, always curious about whether something could be done.
Herbie shows how openness, curiosity, and determination can keep your work interesting for a long, long time.

My main complaint is about [the format]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2022-06-11-tell-a-story-2 %}).
Herbie's music was nowhere to be found, not even in the audiobook.
And his descriptions are a poor alternative.
