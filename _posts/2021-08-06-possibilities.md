The audiobook narrated by Herbie is great.
His impression of Miles is hilarious.

It's not a beautifully written memoir like Patti Smith's _Just Kids_ or Tara Westover's {% post_url_with_hover_card _Educated_ | 2020-04-26-educated %}, but it's a worthy story.
It's fascinating to see how Herbie's collaborations pushed his career forward and how he {% post_url_with_hover_card reinvented himself | 2022-06-11-reinvent-yourself %} over and over, always curious about whether something could be done.
Herbie shows how openness, curiosity, and determination can keep your work interesting for a long, long time.

My main complaint is about {% post_url_with_hover_card the format | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story-2 %}.
Herbie's music was nowhere to be found, not even in the audiobook.
And his descriptions are a poor alternative.
