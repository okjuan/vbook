I am constantly thinking of things I could add to this site.
Here are a few.
<!--more-->

### #logs

To [#essays]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/essays), [#notes]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/notes), [#journal]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/journal), [#reviews]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/reviews), and [#poems]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/poems) I want to add #logs for posts like {% vbook_post _concerts_ | 2024-02-25-concerts-log %}.
Other ideas for logs include: my favorite albums, books I've read, trips I've taken, and even posts like this one, which is a list of things I want to add to this site.
Eventually I could create a log log.
A log of all my logs.
A list of lists.
How pleasing.

### support for referencing a section of a post

I want to support anchor links.
That is, links that take you to a specific section of a post.
The sophisticated version of this would allow me to embed snippets of one post in another.
It could use the same visual element as a hoverbox preview of a post, which I {% vbook_post already support | 2025-03-05-features-on-this-site %} for post links.
This would be in the spirit of the **non-monolithic** attribute of {% vbook_post virtual books | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %}.
(In this paragraph alone there are multiple examples of cases where I could've added a link to section of a post instead of the entire post itself.)

### other ideas

I also use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/okjuan/vbook/issues) to track problems and ideas.
