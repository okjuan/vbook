At the beginning of Chapter Ten of Madeline Miller's _Circe_, the protagonist arrives in Crete, the island that her domineering sister rules oppressively.

Upon docking at the bustling city port, Circe is told to make her way up to the palace immediately.
She narrates:

> Before us, the huge limestone stairs wavered in the heat.
> Men streamed past us, servants and nobles alike, their shoulder sun-darkened and bare.
> Above, the palace of mighty Knossos glowed on its hill like a hive.
> We climbed.
> I heard Daedalus' breaths behind me and Polydamas' in front.
> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

With that last image, the author culminates her depiction of this new context.
She manages to do a lot with a sentence of modest size:

> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

Though she says little about the physical appearance of the staircase, she conjures a vivid image by stirring our imagination about the nature of the kingdom that Circe has entered.
It is a kingdom whose subordinates have long toiled to shuttle riches up from the docks to the throne.
It's a pleasing image.
Concise and evocative.

But I have one problem with it – the execution.
I think her phrasing needed more iteration.
The last bit in particular – **endless hurrying feet** – is a clunky, disappointing resolution.

It was hard to pinpoint what bothered me about it.
At first I thought it was the word **endless**.
I figured I'd replace it with **ceaseless**.
But by the time I'd found a phrasing a preferred, it didn't matter much which of those two I used.

One thing that bothers me is the mushy **-ing** form of **hurry**.
Another is the awkward way **endless** and **hurrying** get in each other's way modifying **feet**.
My instinct is to break up this awkward trio and to pick a more pleasing form of **hurry**, like **hurried** or **hurry** itself, one that is more pleasing to say and hear.

Here's a rephrasing that conserves Miller's idea and that, I posit, improves the sentence that contains it:

> Years of endless hurry up and down the steps had worn them smooth.

Arriving at this version, I notice I like how it sounds.
Perhaps the problem with the original sentence was chiefly one of rhythm.
Reading the two versions one after the others shows how different they are in that respect:

> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

> Years of endless hurry up and down the steps had worn them smooth.
