At the beginning of Chapter Ten of Madeline Miller's _Circe_, the protagonist arrives in Crete, the island that her domineering sister rules oppressively.
<!--more-->
Upon docking at the bustling city port, Circe is told to make her way up to the palace immediately.
She narrates:

> Before us, the huge limestone stairs wavered in the heat.
> Men streamed past us, servants and nobles alike, their shoulders sun-darkened and bare.
> Above, the palace of mighty Knossos glowed on its hill like a hive.
> We climbed.
> I heard Daedalus' breaths behind me and Polydamas' in front.
> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

With that last image, the author culminates her depiction of this new context.
She manages to do a lot with a sentence of modest size:

> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

Though she says little about the physical appearance of the staircase, she conjures a vivid image of it by stirring our imagination about the history and nature of the kingdom that it serves.
It is a kingdom whose subjects have long toiled in relentless heat to shuttle riches up from the docks to the throne.
It's an evocative image delivered concisely.

But I have one problem with it – the execution.
I think the phrasing needed more iteration.
The last bit in particular – **endless hurrying feet** – is a somewhat clunky, disappointing resolution.

It was hard to pinpoint what bothered me about it.
At first I thought it was the word **endless**.
I figured I'd replace it with **ceaseless**.
But by the time I'd found a phrasing I preferred, it didn't matter much which of those two words were used.

One thing that bothers me is the mushy **-ing** form of **hurry**.
Another is the awkward way **endless** and **hurrying** get in each other's way modifying **feet**.
My instinct is to break up this awkward trio and to pick a more pleasing form of **hurry**, like **hurried** or **hurry** itself, one that is more pleasing to say and hear.

Here's a rephrasing that conserves Miller's idea and that I think improves the sentence that contains it:

> Years of endless hurry up and down the steps had worn them smooth.

This rephrasing has a few subtle effects.
By adding **up and down** it gives suitable motion to the image, highlighting the endless hurry of the kingdom's subjects.
And by flipping the order of elements – history first, then present – it refocuses the sentence ultimately on the present, where the action is happening.
But if there is a major improvement I think it is a rhythmic one.
Reading the two versions one after the other shows how different they are in that respect:

> The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.

> Years of endless hurry up and down the steps had worn them smooth.

The phrasing of **were worn smooth** and **endless hurrying feet** stunt the flow of the original sentence.
And perhaps this was an intentional choice by Miller.
In the end, it's a matter of taste and aesthetic affinity.
But I prefer the regular rhythmic flow of my sentence (which I believe is in [Trochaic meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochee)).

Using [Scansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scansion) notation, where a stressed syllable is marked with `/` and an unstressed one with `x`:

```
 x    \    x    \     \     x    \     x  \  x   \  x  x   \
The steps were worn smooth from years of endless hurrying feet.
```

The rhythm of **were worn smooth** is ambiguous to me.
Regardless, the sentence doesn't flow with the same pattern throughout.
On the other hand, this one does:

```
 \    x   \  x   \  x  \   x   \    x   \     x   \    x    \
Years of endless hurry up and down the steps had worn them smooth.
```
