Notes about style and process of writing {% vbook_post how to work #2 | 2023-01-22-work-2 %}.
<!--more-->

I started this piece months ago, alongside others that I still have not published.
I revised my draft and extended it and revised it again.
As I was getting ready to publish it, I got some feedback from my girlfriend that made me want to re-structure the piece.
While I worked on that, I decided to let go of an analogy central to my drafts.
Inspired by ideas in Several short sentences about writing by Verlyn Klinkenborg, I sat down and wrote a new version from scratch, without referencing my previous drafts.
I trusted I had all the ideas I needed already in my head.
I wrote it in order, resisting the temptation to outline the piece.
I tried to finish each paragraph before starting the next one.
What resulted is the final piece.
