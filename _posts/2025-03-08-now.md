Thinking of sentences, reading _Pachinko_ & _The Dominant Animal_, watching _Severance_ & _The White Lotus_.

### thinking of sentences

Two years after {% vbook_post reading about it | 2023-02-25-several-short-sentences %}, I'm finally doing Verlyn Klinkenborg's writing exercise of mentally formulating sentences without writing them down.
I find myself doing it habitually, out of interest.
In the shower while I think over the week's events.
Standing on the balcony in the quiet of morning and watching a neighbor walk their dog over snowy pavement.
One word at a time I lay out a sentence in my head, pruning clutter, swapping out imprecisions, and toying with the order of clauses.
I expect it will make me a better writer.
A lovely surprise was noticing it {% vbook_post making me more present | 2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2 %}.

### reading _Pachinko_ & _The Dominant Animal_

After finishing {% vbook_post The Ginger Man | 2025-01-28-the-ginger-man %}, I felt ready to dive into a novel by James Joyce.
But none of his books are on my list of books to read for 2025 and I'm trying to get better at adhering to plans, so instead I started {% vbook_post _Pachinko_ | 2025-03-08-pachinko %} by Min Jin Lee.
I also just finished {% vbook_post _The Dominant Animal_ | 2025-03-08-dominant-animal %} by Kathryn Scanlan, a remarkable little book of short stories that I've been reading very slowly for the last couple of years.

### watching _Severance_ & _The White Lotus_

I watched the first few episodes of _Severance_ months ago until I lost interest.
But now season two is coming out and many of my friends are talking about it so I resolved to catch up.
Rewatching it I feel again {% vbook_post underwhelmed | 2025-03-08-severance %}.

I much prefer the approach that the writers of _The White Lotus_ have been taking.
Instead of hinting cryptically at forthcoming drama and withholding it for several episodes, they start with a cast of characters with tensions already between and within them.
The potential is there from the beginning.
Throughout the season they build up the existing tensions and introduce new ones until eventually someone takes action or an incident triggers a chain of reactions.
Drama and plot flow naturally from interpersonal dynamics instead of dictating them.

_Severance_ feels designed and implemented from the top down.
_The White Lotus_ feels {% vbook_post incubated | 2024-08-12-tell-a-story-3 %}.
