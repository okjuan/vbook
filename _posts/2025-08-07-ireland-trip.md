Z and I are vacationing in Ireland for a week!
<!--more-->

#### Thursday 08/07/2025 -- Vancouver, BC

- 4:30pm flight YVR -> YYC -> DUB
- watched two interior design videos
- read about Dublin, The Easter Rising, The Troubles
- watched Thomas Flight's 1hr video _Why Movies Will Never Feel the Same_
- read about Marshall McLuhan, the New Criticism, Harold Innis

The late afternoon flight gave me lots of time to get the apartment in order before leaving.
I watered my plants and gathered them all into the office for Z's mom to water while we're away.
Baxter is staying with my mom in Victoria.
I expect he'll bond with her and my younger sister in the three weeks he stays with them as he did with our friends who dogsat him while Z and I were in Indonesia in 2023.
In particular he loves our friend A, who playfought with him.
He loves to playfight.

#### Friday 08/08/2025 -- Dublin

- arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning
- take cab to Airbnb, drop off luggage
- get coffee @ The Little Cactus
- walk down through Smithfield, across River Liffey and into Usher's Quay
- walk west on Thomas Street, then wander south on Meath Street
- eat lunch @ SPACE JARU, then browse @ Marrowbone Books and chat with the worker about authors
- walk east on The Coombe, then into St. Patrick's Park where we lay for a few minutes on the tidily mown grass like others were already doing
- walk east on Golden Lane and Stephen Street until Grafton Street, which was thronging with pedestrians
- watch a man in his thirties tap dance on a square of plywood to the music played by his two peers on guitar and recorder
- pop into St. Stephen's Green for a few minutes, then out and up Dawson Street for caffeinated drinks @ Coffeeangel on the sidewalk patio
- walk up into Fellows' Square in Trinity College to lounge on grass some more, then walk around the perimeter of the pristine College Park cricketground
- came out onto Leinster Street and popped into the National Gallery of Ireland for a look round
- browsed the gift shop and one of the gallery rooms before being ushered out for closing at 5:30pm
- went off on a mini treasure hunt for a Leap card and after we finally got one we took the bus back to Stoneybatter
- dinner @ All Bar Chicken
- walk back to Airbnb to shower and unwind

The locals have been very friendly and helpful.
The cabbie chatted with us cheerfully.
Z anticipates being upstaged in the realm of enthusiastic socializing.

It surprised me how small the city feels.
The weather is gray and mild and windy, good for walking outdoors.
There is a good deal of car traffic.
Many if not most buildings are made of brick and sit at two or three stories.

#### Saturday 08/09/2025 -- Dublin

- solo coffee @ The Little Cactus
- watch episode of The Great House Revival that showed my Irish friend renovate his nanna's cottage in Kerry while I wait for Z to get ready
- brunch @ Brother Hubbard and read on our phones about The Easter Rising
- visit The Spire and GPO, site of The Rising
- walk over O'Connell Bridge
- get coffee @ Copper + Straw
- tour @ Kilmainham Gaol Museum, former prison in which the UK Government held and executed Irish revolutionaries a hundred years ago
- watch Arsenal vs Athletic Club at River Bar

I like it here.
There is abundance of pubs, quality coffee shops, public transit, bike lanes, leftists, and young people.
Z says it reminds her of Vancouver.
