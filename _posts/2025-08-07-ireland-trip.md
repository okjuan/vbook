#### Thursday 08/07/2025 -- Vancouver, BC

- 4:30pm flight YVR -> YYC -> DUB
- watched two interior design videos
- read about Dublin, The Easter Rising, The Troubles
- watched Thomas Flight's 1hr video _Why Movies Will Never Feel the Same_
- read about Marshall McLuhan, the New Criticism, Harold Innis

The late afternoon flight gave me lots of time to get the apartment in order before leaving.
I watered my plants and gathered them all into the office for Z's mom to water while we're away.
Baxter is staying with my mom in Victoria.
I expect he'll bond with her and my younger sister in the three weeks he stays with them as he did with our friends who dogsat him while Z and I were in Indonesia in 2023.
In particular he loves our friend A, who playfought with him.
He loves to playfight.

#### Friday 08/08/2025 -- Dublin

- arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning; take cab to Airbnb, drop off luggage
- get coffee @ The Little Cactus; walk through Smithfield, across River Liffey and into Usher's Quay
- eat lunch @ SPACE JARU, then browse @ Marrowbone Books and chat with the worker about authors
- walk east on The Coombe, then into St. Patrick's Park where we lay for a few minutes on the tidily mown grass like others were already doing
- walk east on Golden Lane and Stephen Street until Grafton Street, which was thronging with pedestrians
- watch a man in his thirties tap dance on a square of plywood to the music played by his two peers on guitar and recorder
- pop into St. Stephen's Green for a few minutes, then out and up Dawson Street for caffeinated drinks @ Coffeeangel on the sidewalk patio
- walk up into Fellows' Square in Trinity College to lounge on grass some more, then walk around the perimeter of the pristine College Park cricketground
- came out onto Leinster Street and popped into the National Gallery of Ireland for a look round
- browsed the gift shop and one of the gallery rooms before being ushered out for closing at 5:30pm
- went off on a mini treasure hunt for a Leap card and after we finally got one we took the bus back to Stoneybatter
- dinner @ All Bar Chicken
- walk back to Airbnb to shower and unwind

The locals have been very friendly and helpful.
The cabbie chatted with us cheerfully.
Z anticipates being upstaged in the realm of enthusiastic socializing.

It surprised me how small the city feels.
The weather is gray and mild and windy, good for walking outdoors.
There is a good deal of car traffic.
Many if not most buildings are made of brick and sit at two or three stories.

#### Saturday 08/09/2025 -- Dublin

- solo coffee @ The Little Cactus
- watch episode of The Great House Revival that showed my Irish friend renovate his nanna's cottage in Kerry while I wait for Z to get ready
- brunch @ Brother Hubbard and read on our phones about The Easter Rising
- visit The Spire and GPO, site of The Rising
- walk over O'Connell Bridge
- get coffee @ Copper + Straw
- tour @ Kilmainham Gaol Museum, former prison in which the UK Government held and executed Irish revolutionaries a hundred years ago
- eat dinner @ Gallaghers Boxty House
- attend stand up comedy @ In Stitches Comedy
- get takeout pizza & fries from Manor Takeaway Foods

I like it here.
There is an abundance of pubs, quality coffee shops, public transit, bike lanes, leftists, and young people.
Z says it reminds her of Vancouver.

Dublin feels bigger today.
It's the weekend and this afternoon there was a friendly game between Leeds United and AC Milan so the streets are chock full of people, many in yellow and white Leeds jerseys and a few Rossoneri sprinkled about.
The city center is swarming with pedestrians, pubs brimming with cheerful drinkers pooling on the sidewalks by the entrance.
Out the windows the sound of live music streams laced with singalongers.
Cars rumble and buses whine and bike bells chime on the street.
Sunshine stretches out on the asphalt and above it lights up the translucent flags that hang angled from building fronts.

#### Sunday 08/10/2025 -- Dublin -> Galway

- solo coffee @ Little Cactus
- breakfast & coffee together @ Little Cactus
- tour @ Henrietta House
- tour & tasting @ Jameson Distillery
- shop for used books in Temple Bar
- pick up car rental @ Dublin Airport (which was a faff and a half)
- pick up luggage from Airbnb and get quick meal from Manor Takeaway Foods
- drive to Galway, settle at B&B and chat with host about what to do tomorrow

At the Jameson Distillery, our host was the most animated one we've had in Dublin.
He waved his arms wildly and in husky bellows rattled off his lines, punctuating them with dual finger snaps and tossing of the Jameson bottle from one hand to the other, the glass clinking against his hand jewelry.
He concluded his opening speech by ramming the bottle down onto a prop book, then as if waking from a trance he commented mildly and mostly to himself that this bottle hadn't broken.
I too was surprised.

On our hike through Glanageenty forest we spoke with Chris about various things.
At one point we got on the topic of gender and he expressed his resent for anti-masculinity messaging he received while growing up.
Lately he had been collecting opinions from people about what it is that makes a man.
A positive definition as opposed to a negative one.

And that's it!
Our first ever week in Ireland.
