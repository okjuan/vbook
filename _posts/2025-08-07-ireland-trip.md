Z and I are vacationing in Ireland for a week!
<!--more-->

#### Thursday 08/07/2025 -- Vancouver, BC

- 4:30pm flight YVR -> YYC -> DUB

The late afternoon flight gave me lots of time to get the apartment in order before leaving.

#### Friday 08/08/2025 -- Dublin

- arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning
- check into Airbnb

Here I will write a sentence or a few about the day, as I will for all the other days.

#### Saturday 08/09/2025 -- Dublin

- tour @ Kilmainham Gaol Museum, former prison in which the UK Government held and executed Irish revolutionaries a hundred years ago

#### Sunday 08/10/2025 -- Dublin -> Galway

- pick up car rental @ Dublin Airport in the afternoon
- drive to Galway

#### Monday 08/11/2025 -- Galway

#### Tuesday 08/12/2025 -- Galway -> Doolin

#### Wednesday 08/13/2025 -- Doolin -> Dingle

#### Thursday 08/14/2025 -- Dingle

- meet with my friends K and C who I befriended in Berlin during my post-graduation travels in the summer of 2019

#### Friday 08/15/2025 -- Dingle -> Cork -> Bristol

- drive to Cork Airport and return rental car
- take evening flight to Bristol to begin our {% vbook_post trip to England | 2025-08-07-england-trip %}!

This will conclude a week in Ireland, a country I had not yet visited.
