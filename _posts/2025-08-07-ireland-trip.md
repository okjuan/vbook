Z and I are vacationing in Ireland for a week from August 8th til the 15th.

#### Thursday 08/07/2025 -- Vancouver, BC

- 4:30pm flight YVR -> YYC -> DUB
- watched two interior design videos
- read about Dublin, The Easter Rising, The Troubles
- watched Thomas Flight's 1hr video _Why Movies Will Never Feel the Same_
- read about Marshall McLuhan, the New Criticism, Harold Innis

The late afternoon flight gave me lots of time to get the apartment in order before leaving.
I watered my plants and gathered them all into the office for Z's mom to water while we're away.
Baxter is staying with my mom in Victoria.
I expect he'll bond with her and my younger sister in the three weeks he stays with them as he did with our friends who dogsat him while Z and I were in Indonesia in 2023.
In particular he loves our friend A, who playfought with him.
He loves to playfight.

#### Friday 08/08/2025 -- Dublin

- arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning; take cab to Airbnb, drop off luggage
- get coffee @ The Little Cactus; walk through Smithfield, across River Liffey and into Usher's Quay
- eat lunch @ SPACE JARU, then browse @ Marrowbone Books & chat with the worker about authors
- continue walk: lounge in St. Patrick's Park; Grafton St., thronging with tourists; St. Stephen's Green
- coffee @ Coffeeangel on the sidewalk patio
- walk into Trinity College: Fellows' Square, around the pristine College Park cricketground
- visit National Gallery of Ireland; dinner @ All Bar Chicken; walk back to Airbnb to shower and unwind

The locals have been very friendly and helpful.
The cabbie chatted with us cheerfully.
Z anticipates being upstaged in the realm of enthusiastic socializing.

It surprised me how small the city feels.
The weather is gray and mild and windy, good for walking outdoors.
There is a good deal of car traffic.
Many if not most buildings are made of brick and sit at two or three stories.

#### Saturday 08/09/2025 -- Dublin

- solo coffee @ The Little Cactus
- brunch @ Brother Hubbard; read on our phones about The Easter Rising
- visit The Spire and GPO, site of The Rising
- coffee @ Copper + Straw
- tour @ [Kilmainham Gaol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmainham_Gaol) Museum (great)
- eat dinner @ Gallaghers Boxty House
- attend stand up comedy @ In Stitches Comedy
- get takeout pizza & fries from Manor Takeaway Foods

I like it here.
There is an abundance of pubs, quality coffee shops, public transit, bike lanes, leftists, and young people.
Z says it reminds her of Vancouver.

Dublin feels bigger today.
It's the weekend and this afternoon there was a friendly game between Leeds United and AC Milan so the streets are chock full of people, many in yellow and white Leeds jerseys and a few Rossoneri sprinkled about.
The city center is swarming with pedestrians, pubs brimming with cheerful drinkers pooling on the sidewalks by the entrance.
Out the windows the sound of live music streams laced with singalongers.
Cars rumble and buses whine and bike bells chime on the street.
Sunshine stretches out on the asphalt and above it lights up the translucent flags that hang angled from building fronts.

#### Sunday 08/10/2025 -- Dublin -> Galway

- solo coffee @ Little Cactus; then breakfast & coffee together
- tour @ Henrietta House
- tour & tasting @ Jameson Distillery
- shop for used books in Temple Bar
- pick up car rental @ Dublin Airport (faff and a half)
- pick up luggage from Airbnb & get quick meal from Manor Takeaway Foods
- drive to Galway, settle at B&B, chat with host about what to do tomorrow

At the Jameson Distillery, our host was the most animated one we've had in Dublin.
He waved his arms wildly and in husky bellows rattled off his lines, punctuating them with dual finger snaps and tossing of the Jameson bottle from one hand to the other, the glass clinking against his hand jewelry.
He concluded his opening speech by ramming the bottle down onto a prop book, then as if waking from a trance he commented mildly and mostly to himself that this bottle hadn't broken.
I too was surprised.

#### Monday 08/11/2025 -- Galway

- breakfast @ 8am; I had a Full Irish Breakfast & Z had french toast with fruits

This was a supremely scenic daytrip.

On our hike through Glanageenty forest we spoke with Chris about various things.
At one point we got on the topic of gender and he expressed his resent for the anti-masculinity messaging he received while growing up.
Lately he had been collecting opinions from people about what it is that makes a man.
A positive definition as opposed to a negative one.

I offered an answer.
To be a good man, {% vbook_post you need self-esteem | 2024-07-04-be-a-man %}.
Without it a man is just a black hole, a devouring force makes nothing from all it consumes.
From low self-esteem arises the desperate and unabating appetite for money, power, women, status, all the proxy symbols of worth.
Those most successful at accumulating these things may feel for a while the fantasy of supremacy (invulnerability) coming true.
Those less able become leeches and parasites that feed on those around them to bolster their feeling of adequacy.

Regardless of one's position in this food chain, however, life is a desperate task.
Every endeavour becomes a stage for bitter competition, every interaction a sparring match if not a duel.
Ground to prove one's worth by coming out on top of someone else.
I think from this personal outlook flows the force of what bell hooks calls the [dominator culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_culture) of the patriarchy, which deprives humanity from both perpetrators and victims.

A person who begins the day with a feeling of adequacy sees no danger in the ordinary.
The unfamiliar is not by default a threat or a trap.
They can be openminded because learning is not proof of their foolishness.
They can be empathetic because they aren't suspicious.
They can respond because they don't need to defend.
They can love because they don't fear they will perish by giving themselves.
