#### Thursday 08/07/2025 -- Vancouver, BC

- arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning
- take cab to Airbnb, drop off luggage
- get coffee @ The Little Cactus
- walk down through Smithfield, across River Liffey and into Usher's Quay
- walk west on Thomas Street, then wander south on Meath Street
- eat lunch @ SPACE JARU, then browse @ Marrowbone Books and chat with the worker about authors
- walk east on The Coombe, then into St. Patrick's Park where we lay for a few minutes on the tidily mown grass like others were already doing
- walk east on Golden Lane and Stephen Street until Grafton Street, which was thronging with pedestrians
- watch a man in his thirties tap dance on a square of plywood to the music played by his two peers on guitar and recorder
- pop into St. Stephen's Green for a few minutes, then out and up Dawson Street for caffeinated drinks @ Coffeeangel on the sidewalk patio
- walk up into Fellows' Square in Trinity College to lounge on grass some more, then walk around the perimeter of the pristine College Park cricketground
- came out onto Leinster Street and popped into the National Gallery of Ireland for a look round
- browsed the gift shop and one of the gallery rooms before being ushered out for closing at 5:30pm
- went off on a mini treasure hunt for a Leap card and after we finally got one we took the bus back to Stoneybatter
