I've been reading [_Tinkers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkers_(novel)) by Paul Harding because I enjoyed listening to [him speak](https://youtu.be/roLRPQPQU58?si=AUVnKRXHxkZ7BWQN) about creative writing, but his writing has somewhat disappointed me.
<!--more-->

Let's consider as an example the vignette that begins on page 50 with the following sentence:
> Ninety-six hours before he died, George said he wanted a shave.

This is a good sentence and, in a sense, a perfect sentence.
It has no flaws.
It does its job and nothing else.
It states two facts in plain terms and allows all meaning to arise from their juxtaposition.
There is a simple and powerful irony in grooming at the edge of personal oblivion.

We learn that, for all his adult life, George kept a daily habit of shaving to stave off his beard of **mangy patches**.
(Supposedly, only a day's stubble **lent him the look of an invalid or a large child incapable of taking care of his own needs.**)
But in his dotage and ill health, George's shaving routine has faltered.
So he asks his family if they might shave him and one of his adult grandchildren volunteers.

Harding gives details like the **bowl of scalding water** and the **cheap disposable plastic razor** that are relevant and meaningful because they foreshadow his grandson's carelessness and invoke the reader to sympathize with the old man.
But Harding also includes details that seem irrelevant and consequently dilute and distract from the meaningful ones.
He mentions that the razor was found by the grandmother **in a basket beneath the bathroom sink that was filled with various disused, soap-crusted toiletry.**
I think **soap-crusted** is the most excessive detail here but the entire description could have been removed.
Harding is giving us too many vivid descriptions.
Only to a certain extent do vivid descriptions make things more vivid to the reader.
At some point, they stop deepening the feeling of immersion in the fictional world and start drawing attention instead to the author and his personality.

We readers have already a reservoir of vivid images we draw from when reading fiction.
It is enough to say that the grandmother **found** a razor in her own house.
That alone may conjure an image of a bathroom cupboard full of nonessential toiletry.
And even if it does not, it conveys the relevant facts.
Firstly, that the old man's usual shaving equipment will not be used.
And secondly, that for some bothersome reason the old man's wife does not know where that equipment is or has neglected to find it.
These subtle, meaningful implications are more salient to readers when the author does not distract them with other, irrelevant information.

A few sentences later, Harding gives an exemplary case.
He purports to describe a fictional world in a colorful way but really just draws attention to his personality and his stylishness as a writer:

> The can [of shaving cream] was old, excavated along with the razor from the guts of the cabinet under the bathroom sink.

For my taste, **excavated** is a needlessly stylish alternative to the typical and sufficient "dug out of" or even the simple "taken".
(I'm reminded of Hemingway's recommendation of Germanic words over Latin words.)
Even more indulgent is **the guts**, which seems a pointless and overblown metaphor for "the inside".
(Hemingway favored the Germanic **guts** over the Latin **viscera**, but of course that is not the issue here.)
This word choice is particularly irritating considering Harding uses it metaphorically five other times throughout the book when referring to the internals of clocks.

It's not a sin to flex your muscles as a writer if you do so by building something compelling.
But I'm afraid Harding succumbs to the temptation of making pointless flourishes and indulgent embellisments all too often, especially for a novel that was [awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pulitzer_Prize).
