Despite how gratifying I found Matthew B. Crawford's concept of Attention Ecologies and how clever I deemed it to take Ecology out of its native context and apply it to the psychological phenomenon of Attention, it never occurred to me to apply it anywhere else.
Then I watched Thomas Flight's video essay _Why The Movies Will Never Feel the Same_ and he offered another astute application.
Media Ecology: the physical and cultural environment in which we watch movies.
Technological advancements have expanded the fundamental aesthetics of film and even more resoundingly they have transformed what it _means_ to watch a movie.

Once, watching a movie meant commuting to a certain place at a specific time to see something that you were likely never to see again.
This meaning is not lost today, but diluted among other meanings.
Today, a movie can be something insignificant.
Lulling stimulation for someone drifting into sleep.
Or welcome distraction for a tired homemaker folding laundry.
And even when watching a movie is the primary activity, it's cheapened by the ease with which we can pause, rewind, rewatch it and by the fact that a thousand alternatives await our whim.

Cinemas endure but the default mode of moviewatching has changed for good.
By giving us easy access to movies, technology has marred their apparent value.
In our media landscape, a movie is a negligent unit in a seemingly endless streaming library and the act of playing one is so trivial that the movie itself feels unimportant.
And the act of moviewatching itself suffers the same effect.

What we need is to reintroduce the limits technology has dutifully removed for our convenience and to reduce the options it has generously accumulated for our benefit.
To recover some of the magic of moviewatching, to recover some of its meaning, we must contrive restraints.
And I think this is feasible without renouncing modern technology.
Its drawbacks are mostly psychological, and the solutions can be the same.
It can be as simple as preparing a list of twenty four movies to watch in the year, an average of two per month.
In this framing, each movie feels much more valuable because they earn their place by excluding other thousands.
And when it comes time to stream one, there is no dullbrained browsing an endless library.

The irony is that this "trick" is representative of reality.
One person will only watch so many movies, a finite number.
A few hundred, maybe?
If we are being duped, it's by the feeling of limitlessness.
Life is _very_ limited, and a sober sense of limits is essential to feeling alive.
