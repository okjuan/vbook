In his video essay _Why The Movies Will Never Feel the Same Again_, Thomas Flight shared an idea that should've occurred to me already.

The idea of _Media Ecology_, which looks at the physical, cultural, and psychological environments wherein we consume media.
Already for the better part of a year I have been thinking about {% vbook_post _Attention Ecology_ | 2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention %}, an idea I found ingenious for taking Ecology out of its native context and applying it to the psychological phenomenon of Attention, and yet it had not yet occurred to me to reproduce that same trick with something else.

Through the lens of Media Ecology, Thomas Flight analyzes how the circumstances of moviewatching dictate what it _means_ to watch a movie.
Once, watching a movie meant commuting to a certain place at a specific time to see something that you were likely never to see again.
It was an occasion, a communal experience among friends, loved ones, neighbors, and other locals.
Today, a movie can be something insignificant and entirely private.
A source of lulling stimulation for someone drifting into sleep or of welcome distraction for a tired homemaker folding laundry.
Movies play a different role in our lives.
The default mode of moviewatching has changed.
Going to the cinema is now the unusual way of watching movies.

This is true of music as well.
In the past, it may have seemed inconceivable to divorce music from its social aspect, but now the primary way to consume it – at least in my "Western" reality – is in personal privacy.
We put devices in our ears that acoustically shut out the world beyond our heads and pipe into our consciousness a private sountrack.
Similarly, books are technologies that encode into symbols the social acts of storytelling and conversation for the solitary consumption of readers.
Each of these mediums is a layer of communication that creates a gulf between us and fills it with virtual experiences of each other.
With one hand media brings us together and with the other it sets us apart.
As a supplement, media is a tremendously enriching substance.
Problems arise when media becomes our primary means for connecting to the world.
It is [the dose that makes the poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison).

Technology is not evil.
But technology gives us power, and power corrupts.
Who can blame a human that, when anxious feelings spring as they do so readily in the kind of lives we live, reaches for the anesthetic device always by their side?
We need barely lift a finger to cast our mind out of the preoccupations in our head and into a virtual source of stimulation tailored to our taste.
Mindless escape is a bad habit that the power of technology makes so easy to indulge.
Chastening and berating ourselves to resist stimulation that is so easily accessible is a poor strategy.
A much more efficient and productive one is ecological, one that looks to the nature of the organisms and to the nature of their environment.

What we need – to preserve the magic of moviewatching and more generally to neutralize the ills of our unadulterated access to infinite digital streams – is to reintroduce the limits technology has dutifully removed for our convenience and to reduce the options it has generously accumulated for our benefit.
We must contrive restraints to create new default behaviors.
A simple tactic I've used this year is to begin with a short list of books I planned to read throughout the year.
Each time I finish one I check it off my list and each time I want to begin a new one I peruse the remaining options.
With satisfaction I've watched the checkmarks accumulate gradually and felt each time a jolt of enthusiastic motivation to pick up the next book.
I feel the value of each book on the list because its membership comes at the cost of excluding other millions and I spend very little time feeling like I'm missing out because I have mentally eliminated an endless library of options.
If I'm reading this book, I'm only ignoring a few others and I will get to those soon enough anyhow.

It's startling how powerful a contrived rule can be.
It seems silly that the human mind could be duped so easily, but then again it is a testament to its power that it can take an idea and construct from it a reality.
I suppose it is precisely this affinity and ease with virtual domains that gets us into trouble in the first place.
