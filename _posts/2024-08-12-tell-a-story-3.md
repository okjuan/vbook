Can quantifying the attributes of a TV show tell us something about its quality?

I reckon some of the flaws in _House of the Dragon_ would be reflected in statistics like amount of dialogue per minute and number of decisions made per character.
A non-negligible amount of time is spent on dramatic montages and orchestral music that create a moody atmosphere and remind us of how serious the situation is.
This comes at the cost of time that could be spent on actual situations and actual drama, or at least character development that would contribute to future drama.

These two elements -- dialogue and decision-making -- each give us an independent perspective into a character, but their combination is especially powerful because it gives us a third angle: insight into what a character is _thinking_, including what they are thinking unconsciously.
From this we get what might be the critical ingredient of great story-telling: three-dimensional characters.

My qualm with shows like _House of the Dragon_ is that their plot feels designed and implemented.
I sense the presence of writers and their attempts to show me what's happening and persuade me that it makes sense.
I can't get lost in the fictional world as if it were a real one because I see the pencil marks from when it was sketched out.
My [suspension of disbelief](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Suspension_of_disbelief) never takes off.
One might say, Well, yeah, all fictional plots are prescribed.
But they're not, and writers like Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy have {% post_url_with_hover_card attested to it | 2023-12-01-where-ideas-come-from %}.

Great shows like _The Sopranos_ often feel to me like they are happening spontaneously, developing by themselves as a continuous chain of events, reactions, and actions.
I don't feel like the writers are leading me to the plot's predetermined destination.
In fact I don't feel their presence at all.
I feel like I'm {% post_url_with_hover_card witnessing something | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story %}.
In _The Sopranos_, plot is not implemented, it's incubated.
