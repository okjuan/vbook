What makes Martin Tyler a good commentator?
<!--more-->

_(This is a work in progress.)_

He is one of the most recognizable voices of football commentary and has been, for decades, commentating football matches of the English Premier League and UEFA Champions League.
He was voted the FA Premier League Commentator of the Decade in 2003.
So memorable is his distinct voice that it left an indelible mark in soccer-obsessed childhood in Mexico City, Saturday and Sunday mornings of which I spent playing [FIFA](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/FIFA_(video_game_series)) on Xbox, to which he lent his voice from 2005 until 2019.
What makes him so good?

First of all, he's nice to listen to.
His accent is agreeable, his voice is deep and distinctive, and he speaks in leisurely rhythm.
> TODO: example of the rhythm (e.g. using ellipses and dashes)

However, mostly pleasing is his eloquence.
> [Hull City] got their early grip on [the game]. Of course, it's been loosened. Of course, the longer it goes on, you tend to feel, as a seasoned football watcher, that class will out, and there's a bit more class sprinkled in the Arsenal team than the Hull ranks.

Condensed in this small sample are various techniques that make Martin Tyler a stylish orator.

One is parallelism -- e.g. sequential statements starting with **Of course** -- which he uses **a lot**.
Another is his coordination of metaphors: Hull's **grip** being **loosened**.
He varies how he words things: **the Arsenal team** v.s. **the Hull ranks**.
Interesting phrasing: **class will out**, which I had to look up to understand.

After Hull City, shockingly, score a second goal before ten minutes have elapsed:
> Well, Curtis Davies scored in the fifth round win against Brighton, he scored in the quarter-final win against Sunderland, and he's now scored to give Steve Bruce... well, it's more than a dream, if there is such a thing! It's an unbelievable beginning for the overwhelming underdogs, underdogs with a real bite in them though.

Notice his dual use of **classic** in his reaction to Santi Cazorla's free kick goal:
> Santi Cazorla! Arsenal one, Hull two. A class free kick, and we're headed for a classic FA Cup final.

A couple minutes later:
> The force is with Arsenal at the moment, the lead is with Hull City.

When Arsenal completes their comeback from trailing by two goals to leading by one:
> The damage seems to be repaired, the comeback looks to be complete.

> Arsenal have never been outside of North London to get to this final in North London.
Textually, this looks like clunky redundance.
But when he says it, Tyler emphasizes **get**, which splits the statement into two, symmetrical pieces.
It's also a subtle way to signal that he intended the repetition, which prevents the listener from interpreting it as clumnsiness.

He even does it when replying the second commentator, who says:
> It's not the most severe tackle you've ever seen.
Tyler responds:
> And it's not the most severe punishment that you've ever seen.

As for **class will out** -- I had to turn up the volume and replay a couple times to make sure I'd heart Martin Tyler right.
He clearly says **class will out**.
I googled around and found [this definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/out#Verb) of **out** as a verb:
> to become public, revealed, or apparent.
There is even an example from another football commentator:
> In those opening minutes City looked like a team that were not ready for Celtic's intensity. They looked a bit shocked to be involved in a fight. Class will out, though.

Tyler's commentary is engaging in part due to his playful and interesting phrases:
> They will be feeling the pain of a lack of gain, if you like.

When Hull City are losing by one goal in the last few minutes and the camera cuts to Hull's manager, who is wearing long sleeve button up shirt on a sunny day in mid-May:
> What has Steve Bruce got up those sleeves of his.

This also highlights another subtle detail of good commentating: addressing what is shown on screen.
Most of the broadcast consists of
Most of the time, it's the wide shot of the soccer field
Peppered throughout the broadcast are brief shots of fans in the stands, coaches and players on the sidelines.

Tyler contrasts between the mood of Arsenal fans and Hull City fans:
> Well, they were quiet for a long time, and they were in full voice.
He says the first part of the sentence when the broadcast shows Arsenal fans leaping and dancing with joy, and then, when it suddenly cuts to a closeup shot of two dejected Hull city fans, he says the second part.
He delivers the line with such ease that it's easy to forget that he is reacting in real time to what is being shown on screen.

Variation
> It's difficult for the referees in the cup final, we've seen it down the years. They want to give everybody a chance. There's been very few dismissals in this prestigious occasion.
After mentioning **the cup final**, he refers back to it with an alternative description, **this prestigious occasion**, which also explains why the referees are so cautious and restrained.

Variation of phrasing too.
Tyler likes to invert sentences, which makes for interesting variety.
Instead of saying:
> Today is a different story.
Or:
> This is a different story.
Tyler says:
> Different story, here.

Shortly afterwards, as Davies trots towards his opponent's penalty box, in preparation for another corner:
> Up goes Davies again.

Speaking about players sitting on the bench, Tyler says:
> Maynor Figueroa, you have to feel for him.

When Aaron Ramsey scores the winning goal in Extra Time, Tyler exclaims:
> Oh, brilliantly taken! Absolutely brilliantly taken by Aaron Ramsey! He's got one right! And Arsenal finally lead, deep into extra time!

When the final whistle blows, and Arsenal finally win, despite a valiant effort from Hull:
> The pride to Hull, the prize to Arsenal.

If you watch the [the whole match](https://www.youtube.com/live/ImTcg3pmoCw?si=dGl87rMgX8wCwv5e), or at least the few minutes leading up to the winning goal Tyler sounds, especially

Watching [the match highlights](https://youtu.be/7K5j4mMfBK0?si=V1MDiPA8iNpTx2Wi), Tyler
> The commentator was lifeless. When Arsenal scored the winner he really showed that he cared...lol
Tyler is almost eighty years old and, nowadays, there is a new favorite, who is perfectly suited to match highlights: Peter Drury.
Both are elegant orators, but Tyler's style is more languid, Drury's is more energetic.

A more popular commentator nowadays, and one better suited to the dramatized summarization of matches (YouTube highlights), is Peter Drury.

Notes: things I want to say about Peter Drury
- His first rule: get the facts right -- who's the player kicking the ball right now?
- The way he delays saying the name of a player who is having an attempt on goal until _after_ they've dispatched their attempt and it is discernible whether the attempt might be successful. E.g. Xhaka to... Saliba!!! (leftie goal from edge of the box)
- Another rule of commentating: express the excitement that a fan feels for the game
    - Give example of "Roma has risen from their ruins! A Greek god in Rome!" (perhaps almost getting hammy?)
- He does his homework before the game
    - this is one of the fundamental contributions from commentators: contextualize by bringing up relevant facts
        e.g. Tyler in the FA Cup final: > Santi Cazorla, he's in the mood. Played a big part in the earlier rounds, too, scoring in the win against Tottenham and against Coventry in the fourth round.

Years ago I was surprised to find that searching for "English commentary" and then for specific commentators was common enough that they showed up as suggested auto-complete searches on YouTube and Google.
It turns out it is a common interest.
There are even montages on YouTube like [this one](https://youtu.be/H0FXV-JDCsc?si=dXjzUl3h60JieB4l) that focus on the performance of the commentators rather than of the players.
