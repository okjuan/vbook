The other day I picked a bunch of books from my library and tried to start each of them.
I had [energy and free time](https://okjuan.medium.com/is-this-working-2-4343dc4594eb).
None stuck.
Until one did.
That's the one I read.

Instead of forcing order, I let impulse lead.
I have dozens and dozens of unread books sitting on my shelves, but for my next book I often buy a new one.
If I'm currently interested in a particular topic or author, I follow that.
Curiosity and appetite, though they may take you in new directions, make for great fuel.
Working by willpower, on the other hand, drains you.

Unsupervised impulses can lead us down paths not worth pursuing.
I try to guide myself gently onto one of various directions I've consciously chosen.
I move in unpredictable bursts but I move freely.
I make progress in uneven quantities but I make progress.
