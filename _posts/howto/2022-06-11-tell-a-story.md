*(This is a slightly edited excerpt from my piece [The Virtual Book](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360).)*

Decades ago, The New Yorker and other magazines experimented with the journalistic form by introducing literary techniques into it. Writers aspired not just to document scenes but to recreate them for readers to witness. Though some criticized this practice for warping truth through interpretation, some writers flourished in it. Tom Wolfe, a practitioner and evangelist of the method, compiled exemplary articles in his book The New Journalism. According to Wolfe, using techniques of literary realism was like adding electricity into the otherwise mechanical machine of journalism. By using dialogue, [point-of-view]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-06-30-narrate-transparently %}), and symbolism, writers could achieve “absolute involvement of the reader”.

The anthology includes a passage from Hunter S. Thompson’s nonfiction novel on the Hell’s Angels, which he wrote after a year of living with the outlaws. Thompson depicts a tense confrontation between the notorious motorcyclists and locals of Bass Lake, a favourite destination for the gang’s Labor Day tradition of binge-drinking and mayhem-making.

> “If you play straight with us, Sonny, we’ll play straight with you. We don’t want any trouble and we know you guys have as much right to camp on this lake as anybody else. But the minute you cause trouble for us or anyone else, we’re gonna come down on you hard, it’s gonna be powder valley for your whole gang.”

On the day, Thompson’s newspaper editor requested “no more than an arty variation of the standard wire-service news blurb: Who, What, When, Where, and Why.” But, in his book, Thompson gives us much more. He doesn’t report the events in the cold, detached voice of the typical journalist observing from the sidelines. Nor does he simply list the facts and state the outcome. He recounts, in first person, the experience of being caught in a stand-off between outlaws known for their brutality and a makeshift militia of locals determined to defend their town:

> “The first one of these sonsofbitches that gives me any lip I’m gonna shoot right in the belly. That’s the only language they understand.”

The reader leaves not with memorizable facts, but a secondhand experience:

> I was standing in the midst of about a hundred vigilantes…as I looked around I saw that many carried wooden clubs and others had hunting knives on their belts. They didn’t seem mean, but they were obviously keyed up and ready to bust some heads…under these circumstances the only neutrals were the tourists, who were easily identifiable. On my way out of town I wondered if anybody in Bass Lake might take one of my aspen-leaf checks for a fluorescent Hawaiian beach suit and some stylish sandals.
