The idea is that, through sheer thought, you can mobilize a body sapped of motivation.
Willpower is like [the secret gas](https://youtu.be/TuEdU_lrtZk) in your car that hides below the E on the fuel gauge.
Except it never runs out.
Mind over matter.

But isn't the heroic surge of energy released from this mental trapdoor merely motivation?
Sure, you've had to rummage and claw for it, but what is it if not motivation?
