It's important to keep your metaphors from bumping into one another.

Take this passage from Oliver Burkeman's book [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks):
> ...most of us were raised [to] prioritize future benefits over current enjoyments. But ultimately it backfires. It **wrenches** us out of the present, leading to a life spent **leaning** into the future, worrying about whether things will work out...

If we are **wrenched** out of the present, how are we only **leaning** into the future?
Wouldn't we be **thrown** into it?

To coordinate these two metaphors, we need to change the word **wrenches** or the word **leaning**.
(Or both.)
The image of being **wrenched out of the present** is vivid, but I find the image of **leaning into the future** more precise.

Burkeman could've chosen a word other than **wrenches** to lead better into the image of **leaning**.
Possibilities include: **pushes**, **nudges**, **tips**, **pulls**, **shifts**.
We are not limited to physicality, either: action words like **coaxes** and **lures** are also viable.

We can't use **leads** because that would clash with **leading** in the second part of the sentence.
(Although, if we really liked **leads** as a replacement for **wrenches**, we could [revise the sentence]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-05-09-revise-a-sentence %}) to accomodate it.)

To pick a solution, test it against the problem.
You know you've found a solution when the two images flow into each other or click into place like neighboring puzzle pieces.
