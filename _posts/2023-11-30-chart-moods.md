Learning to pick between {% post_url_with_hover_card _productive_ and _absorptive_ | 2021-04-25-work %} activities based on my current mood and energy level has helped me notice, for example, when I should try to write instead of reading.

&#8592; productive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; absorptive &#8594;

It occurred to me recently that there are many other dimensions to consider when picking an activity.
An obvious distinction is _active_ vs _passive_ activities.
It is similar to _productive_ vs _absorptive_, but it's possible to be absorptive both actively (e.g. reading) and passively (e.g. watching, listening).

&#8592; active &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passive &#8594;

Are you in a mood to expend energy or do you need to refuel?
The same answer will have different implications for different people.
For introverted people, having "expensive" capacity at a given moment offers an opportunity to socialize.

&#8592; expensive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regenerative &#8594;

After determining that you want to watch a movie -- a fine choice when one is feeling passive-absorptive-regenerative -- you can figure out whether you want to do your passive absorbing alone or with other people.

&#8592; individual &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; social &#8594;

While going through this exercise, you don't have to pick a point on each spectrum.
I think it's unlikely you'll have answers for all.
(Ah yes, I'm feeling productive-active-social-regenerative, that's the word I was looking for!)
But with every choice, you filter down many possible activities into the ones best suited to your current mood.

Are you in a social-regenerative mood?
Meet with friends to do something that nourishes you.
Or are you feeling social-expensive?
Do something that you're not easily motivated to do but that your loved ones want to do with you.

I always try to choose activities based on how I'm feeling so I can evade the taxing experience of forcing myself to do something through willpower alone.
But you can't always wait for the right mood to come.
In life, you have to do some planning, and you can do that better if you learn how your moods and energy levels fluctuate.

Notice which activities are expensive for you.
Make time after those for your regenerative activites.
Whether you're more introverted or extroverted, take note of how often you need social interaction to keep a healthy balance.
Whether you're a morning person or a night owl, dedicate your expensive mood to {% post_url_with_hover_card meaningful, important work | 2023-01-22-work-2 %}.
If producing is important to you, dedicate time to absorbing as well.
