### my 2025 in music

Like I mentioned {% vbook_post last year | 2025-01-12-2024-in-review %}, I create a playlist every year to collect songs that were special to me.
These playlists are little time capsules that I can unlatch with special attention in the future and be transported into the past.

### my 2025 on this site

This year I wrote many more `/now` updates.
Twelve, in fact!
Some months I wrote multiple, some I wrote none.
I wrote the {% vbook_post last one | 2025-12-22-now %} on December 22nd.
From that one you can click back in time through all my `/now` updates because this year I implemented a feature that automatically links posts if they are part of a series.
A post is part of a series if its title ends with a number, like {% vbook_post _what I'm doing now #18_ | 2025-12-22-now %} for example.

Specifically about 2025 I wrote a few pieces, and they were all experimental in form.
Firstly, I wrote {% vbook_post _what I am doing in 2025_ | 2025-01-18-my-2025 %}, a "live journal" written incrementally throughout the year.
I also kept a "{% vbook_post done list | 2025-05-17-done %}" of things I did in the whole year.
Finally, at the end of the year, I wrote {% vbook_post a retrospective | 2025-12-15-2025-retro %} in a new, interactive format I'm calling _stacks_.
