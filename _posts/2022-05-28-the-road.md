A poor adaptation... too literal.
<!--more-->
The dialogue and scenes are lifted out of the book, probably in an attempt to stay true to it.
The film should've attempted to translate the story to tap into the strengths and respect the weaknesses of the medium.
It's hard work but would've had a better chance of representing the feelings of the book.
Nomadland, for example, better captures the feelings of those who dare to live and love despite a crushing despair.
