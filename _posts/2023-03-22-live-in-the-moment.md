It is old advice to live now because now is the only time you will ever live.
Embrace this moment because it is the only one in reach.

But the advice resonates only so deeply with me.
I find many nows made for trading, worthy of giving up for what I can get later.

To this cliche {% vbook_post Oliver Burkeman | 2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks %} adds a darker harmony with a note of his own.
You will never make the most of your time.
It is painfully short and any bid for optimal use of it is doomed.
Suddenly the original cliche is not about changing your attitude but about accepting that you get what you get.
The task is not about settling, but about admitting defeat.
Time rules you and the freest you can get is by giving up the fight.
