I just love the writing.
<!--more-->
(Except for the very dubious Asian jokes... why twice, Paul, why?)
As in The Master and There Will Be Bood, beyond writing plot, PTA writes characters and develops a dynamic between them.
The golf course scene -- Tom Waits leads a crowd, martini glasses in hand, to the 8th hole, stokes a fire in a sand trap, and goads Sean Penn to fly over it on a motorcycle -- isn't just hilarious but also lets Gary and Alana complete another oscillation of their co-dependent cycle.
Alana baits Gary manipulatively, giving her the upper hand and the precocious 15 year-old something to reach for.
(When she's within reach, he stops himself.)
They are in a dance of mutual validation and withholding, careful not to tip the balance by entering into something honest -- between a 15 year-old and a 25 year-old, a friendship where you keep each other company instead of playing power games.
