This is a quote from the very intriguing book [_A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language) from 1977, which I came across while thumbing through the Seattle Public Library's virtual collection on Libby.
Something about the odd title and the minimal, uncommercial cover called to me.
I checked it out.
I perused it and then left it alone.
That was a few years ago, but its basic idea has stuck with me.

The book lists two hundred and fiftythree architectural and planning concepts -- ranging "from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs," as the [Wikipedia page](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/A_Pattern_Language) puts it.
They are defined abstractly, assembled loosely in a network of references, and offered modestly as "hypotheses", proposed solutions to common problems.
I find the approach -- flexible and deferential -- rather appealing.
It's pleasantly surprising to read that it inspired the [first online wiki](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/WikiWikiWeb).
I could even see a thread to my concept of {% post_url_with_hover_card virtual books | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %}.

I love interior design, placemaking, vibesetting.
I've loved furnishing, laying out, and decorating my apartments, and lately I've been mulling over the question: what are, for me, the most important aspects of a living space?
I like to think about it as assembling my own pattern language.

### i) a good bed

A full for myself, queen or king if I'm sharing with my wife.
Two pillows for myself.
Fitted sheet and a duvet, no top sheet.
The duvet cover made of a high quality, breathable material in a nice color.
It must have eight ties inside it to keep the duvet in place and a zipper at the bottom hidden behind a flap.
While using the bed, I don't want to notice a separation between the duvet and its cover.

### ii) flat, walk-in shower

I never take baths.
Even when I do, they're not so much a luxury as a trifle.
I love walk-in showers.
Not having to step over the edge of a tub and not having to worry about slipping while showering are very subtle delights.
Nice tiles are a plus.

### iii) diffused & ambient lighting

I hate overhead lighting that is bright and direct.
The inconvenience of switching off five lamps in a living room is nothing compared to having to withstand the piercing glare of bare bulbs shining down horribly into my eyes.
For switch-operated room lights, I much prefer track lighting aimed at the wall or lights diffused by rice paper pendants.
The goal is to create a [soup of light](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTsun7JQzd0off7M8o5DlJ983OV63snW?si=xKxDqYwS4oq-6glt).

Also, as per pattern #252, _pools of light_, lights should accentuate or even delineate spaces and subspaces.
Don't just light a whole room, light each space within the room.
And, importantly, "spaces" should be defined by human activity and experience: a private corner where you or your loved ones sit to read, an area where a little group may sit to talk or play games, etc.

### iv) plants

Especially leafy ones.
Pothos, monstera, ficus.
I'm not a huge fan of aloe veras or succulents.
Snake plants are ok.

### v) comfy couch

Whenever I see a home tour on YouTube and it lacks a cushy sofa in the living room, I mourn it.
Armchairs and chairs are not enough.
For me, couches are fundamental.

I am picky how the couch feels to sit on, too.
I think I prefer a slightly low and certainly a deep seat.
Its texture and color matter, too.

Also, see pattern #251, _different chairs_, which provides seating variety to create options for different people or the same people in different moods.

### vi) dishwasher

I don't like to wash dishes by hand.
It takes so long.
And it feels meaningless, unlike other chores, like plant watering.
Plus, I'm prone to excema.

### vii) ample natural light

I need big and many windows.
In the living room, at least, artificial lighting should be optional in the daytime.
Northfacing windowsills (in the northern hemisphere) are fantastic for plants.
Direct sunlight is nice, even if just a little bit.

### viii) coffee setup

Preferrably an espresso machine with a grinder with a portafilter holder.
At least, a pourover setup: a gooseneck kettle, a cone dripper, a scale, and a burr grinder.

### ix) TV with a good sound system

Makes me sad to watch movies on TV speakers.

### x) artwork

On the walls.
Nothing fancy.
Nicelooking stuff and stuff with personal significance (see pattern #253, _things from your life_).
Not generic or massproduced prints.
Trendy interior design brands have ruined Matisse figure prints, at least for a few years.

### xi) desk with a monitor

Preferrably with a big table surface.
Bonus points for a mounted monitor that doesn't take up any deskspace and can be swiveled out of the way.

### xii) nice dishware

I like an assortment of glasses and mugs.
Nice shapes, materials, and weight.
Uniform cutlery.
Matching set of dishes, bowls, and bowl plates.

I don't care for the massproduced mugs, regardless of what image or words are imprinted on them.
I like large handles so that it is easy to hold the mug with one hand without touching or bumping into the hot mug's sidesurface.

### xiv) easy & fast access to street

It's annoying to fish for my keys or a fob to unlock doors.
For that reason, I sometimes prefer parking on the street than in a garage.
In general, I love being able to walk out of my home and virtually straight onto the street.
I like views but they're not worth long elevator waits.
A view of a nice neighborhood street or of leafy trees is enough for me.

After writing the above, I revisited the book.
Thanks to its relative obscurity, the ebook version was available to borrow immediately from the Seattle Public Library.
I'm pleased to find out the authors encourage readers to come up with their own pattern languages.
I also like their idea of ordering from big to small, with forward references that elucidate how subpatterns help realize larger ones and with backreferences to contextualize patterns in larger ones.
