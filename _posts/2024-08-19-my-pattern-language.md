That's a quote from [_A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language), a book published in 1977 that I came across a few years ago while thumbing through the Seattle Public Library's virtual collection on Libby.
Something about the unusual title and the minimal, uncommercial cover called to me.
I checked it out, perused it, then put it aside.
I spent scant time with it, but its basic idea stuck with me.

> The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

The book lists two hundred and fiftythree of these, spanning in scope from regions to rooms and graded with the degree of confidence that the authors have in the solution's immutability.
Despite being defined loosely to allow flexible application, the patterns are also defined concretely, often specified numerically and illustrated with pictures and diagrams.
The patterns are ordered by scale from big to small, but they also contain references that connect them into subnetworks.
Forward references elucidate how larger patterns depend on smaller ones and backreferences contextualize patterns in larger ones.

I find the approach -- flexible, deferential, and associative -- rather appealing.
In fact, the book abides by various principles of my {% post_url_with_hover_card virtual book | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %} idea, namely: multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, and nonmonolithic.
As a big fan of wikis, I'm pleased to read that it inspired the [first online wiki](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/WikiWikiWeb).
And as a programmer, I'm intrigued to learn that it inspired the idea of [software design patterns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Software_design_pattern), which are a core part of the industry vernacular.

The book is, finally, an inspiration for me to create my own pattern language.
I love interior design, placemaking, vibesetting, and lately I've been thinking about what elements make a homespace great.
I've loved furnishing, laying out, and decorating my apartments, and I look forward to owning a house someday.

### i) good bed

A full for myself, queen or king if I'm sharing with my wife.
Two pillows for myself.
Fitted sheet and a duvet, no top sheet.
The duvet cover made of a high quality, breathable material in a nice color.
It must have eight ties inside it to keep the duvet in place and a zipper at the bottom hidden behind a flap.
While using the bed, I don't want to notice a separation between the duvet and its cover.

The frame must be sturdy and stable.
No squeaking when getting in and out of bed.

### ii) walk-in shower

I never take baths.
Even when I do, they're not so much a luxury as a trifle.
Showering, on the other hand, is special.
It is, first of all, a daily respite, a place to relax and recharge.
But what makes it invaluable is that it doubles as an opportunity to {% post_url_with_hover_card listen to my subsconscious | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %}.
And for this moment to flourish fully and consistently, I need the right physical space.

Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean while their mind wanders.
To achieve this, it must make it extremely easy to do all the basic things: get in, stand, wash, rinse, and get out.
It sounds obvious, but the standard tubshower hybrid most of us have at home {% post_url_with_hover_card fails this basic test | 2024-08-30-good-shower %}.

Bonus points for nice tiles and for a flat entry with no intermediary ledge.

### iii) diffused & ambient lighting

I hate overhead lighting that is bright and direct.
The inconvenience of switching off five lamps in a living room is nothing compared to having to withstand the piercing glare of bare bulbs shining down horribly into my eyes.
For switch-operated room lights, I much prefer track lighting aimed at the wall or lights diffused by rice paper pendants.
The goal is to create a [soup of light](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTsun7JQzd0off7M8o5DlJ983OV63snW?si=xKxDqYwS4oq-6glt).

Also, as per pattern #252, _pools of light_, lights should accentuate or even delineate spaces and subspaces.
Don't just light a whole room, light each space within the room.
And, importantly, "spaces" should be defined by human activity and experience: a private corner where you or your loved ones sit to read, an area where a little group may sit to talk or play games, etc.

### iv) plants

Especially leafy ones.
Pothos, monstera, ficus.
I'm not a huge fan of aloe veras or succulents.
Snake plants are ok.

### v) comfy couch

Whenever I see a home tour on YouTube and it lacks a cushy sofa in the living room, I mourn it.
Armchairs and chairs are not enough.
For me, couches are fundamental.

I am picky how the couch feels to sit on, too.
I think I prefer a slightly low and certainly a deep seat.
Its texture and color matter, too.

Also, see pattern #251, _different chairs_, which provides seating variety to create options for different people or the same people in different moods.

### vi) dishwasher

I don't like to wash dishes by hand.
It takes so long.
And it feels meaningless, unlike other chores, like plant watering.
Plus, I'm prone to excema.

### vii) ample natural light

I need big and many windows.
In the living room, at least, artificial lighting should be optional in the daytime.
Northfacing windowsills (in the northern hemisphere) are fantastic for plants.
Direct sunlight is nice, even if just a little bit.

### viii) coffee setup

Preferrably an espresso machine with a grinder with a portafilter holder.
At least, a pourover setup: a gooseneck kettle, a cone dripper, a scale, and a burr grinder.

### ix) TV with a good sound system

Makes me sad to watch movies on TV speakers.

### x) artwork

On the walls.
Nothing fancy.
Nicelooking stuff and stuff with personal significance (see pattern #253, _things from your life_).
Not generic or massproduced prints.
Trendy interior design brands have ruined Matisse figure prints, at least for a few years.

### xi) worktable with a monitor

I say worktable instead of desk because my current worktable is actually our dinner table.
It's a great setup because we don't use it much otherwise.

Preferrably with a big table surface.
Bonus points for a mounted monitor that doesn't take up any deskspace and can be swiveled out of the way.

### xii) nice dishware

I like an assortment of glasses and mugs.
Nice shapes, materials, and weight.
Uniform cutlery.
Matching set of dishes, bowls, and bowl plates.

I don't care for the massproduced mugs, regardless of what image or words are imprinted on them.
I like large handles so that it is easy to hold the mug with one hand without touching or bumping into the hot mug's sidesurface.

### xiii) easy & fast access to street

It's annoying to fish for my keys or a fob to unlock doors.
For that reason, I sometimes prefer parking on the street than in a garage.
In general, I love being able to walk out of my home and virtually straight onto the street.
I like views but they're not worth long elevator waits.
A view of a nice neighborhood street or leafy trees is enough for me.

### xiv) places to set things down

I'm a strong believer in having a designated place at the entrance for placing house keys upon entry.
And I recently noticed that there's a similar satisfaction in having places throughout the house for settings things down.
A spot next to each seat for setting down a drink.
A place to put a kitchen tray when not in use.
A surface to set down glasses and mugs that need to be brought to the kitchen.
(I'll have to revisit and develop this pattern.)

After writing the above, I revisited the book.
Thanks to its relative obscurity, the ebook version was available to borrow immediately from the library.
I'm pleased to find out the authors encourage readers to come up with their own pattern languages.
It occurs to me that some of the my patterns might have some tacit principles in common.
I want to deduce them and make them explicit so I can reference them from relevant patterns and thereby uncover principles that underpin my whole pattern language.

### a) avoid causes of mental clutter & friction

I'm trying to articulate the common principle, assuming there is one, between my preference for _(i)_ a sole duvet and for _(ii) a walk-in shower_.
In the same way I resent having to think about stepping into a bathtub and about where I step while I shower, I resent having to keep track of a top sheet while in bed.
I much prefer to interact exclusively with the duvet.
I am aware that it sounds contrived or even slightly insane, but these things cause me minor mental friction that I wish I could eliminate in totality.

I think there are many little bits in my patterns that can be traced to my intolerance for mental friction.
My distaste for _(xiii)_ having to unlock doors on my way out of my home or having to wait an indeterminate amount of time for an elevator.
My preference for _(xii)_ big mug handles, so I don't have worry about holding the mug a certain way to avoid burning my knuckles.
Before bluetooth headphones became ubiquitous, wired headphones caused me constant psychological chafe.
I hated having to supervise that pesky dangling cord.
To minimize the probability of it catching on protruding bits, like the jagged knobs of our kitchen cabinets, I used to run the cord up my shirt along my back, out through the neckhole, and into my ears like I was in the secret service.
(This was my variant on the common practice of running headphones under the shirt on the _front_ side, which had the issue that, when not in use, the cord would swing in front of you.)
I bought my first pair of cordless headphones in 2018 and they were a revelation.
The freedom was exquisite.
Nowadays it's easy to take for granted.


### b) allow for incremental discovery and gradual changes

I realized how much I love walk-in showers because my current Seattle apartment has one.
In fact, I love it so much that, when we got a roommate, I requested continued access to the bathroom where it is.

Because most of my plants sit on individual wooden stools with small footprints, I've been able to rearrange their place in the apartment over the last two years or so.

### c) cultivate meaning in objects and places

A place for keys at the entrance is convenient for arrival and departure, and it effects a pleasant sense of transition.
Arriving, it feels nice to unburden oneself of logistical paraphernalia necessary for navigating the world outside, which accentuates the feeling of returning to a place of convenience, comfort, and familiarity.
Departing, it feels nice to equip oneself before stepping through the doorway into the world.

Ordinary actions like these can have meaning.
This imbuing of meaning into inanimate objects and impersonal surroundings is the part of the process that transforms a house into a home.
A building or even a room becomes a place where one is provided for and secure, where one can rest at ease.

A home is sprinkled with meaning throughout.
A quiet, comfy place to read and relax.
A welcoming common area to be together.
A room of one's own, a private space.
All these are ordinary physical spaces that provide precious and intangible nourishment.

It's obvious that we should avoid and dispel negative meanings from our home.
Less obvious is the task of preventing neutrality and meaninglessness.
The lack of meaning is more insidious than negative meaning for a few reasons.
Firstly, because its presence is not obvious.
Every bit and every corner without meaning is like a little leak that create together a void of meaning that can be felt but not easily traced to a source.
They silently steal from our home's potential as a place for rest and renewal.

Negative energy is easier to detect and pinpoint, and its invasiveness is felt more sharply, which spurs us into action.
Meaninglessness, on the other hand, is stultifying.
It confuses and bores us with its lack of specificity and sedates us by promoting numbness and detachment.
