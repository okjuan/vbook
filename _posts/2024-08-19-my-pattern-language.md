That's a quote from [_A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language), a book published in 1977 that I came across a few years ago while thumbing through the Seattle Public Library's virtual collection on Libby.
Something about the unusual title and the minimal, uncommercial cover called to me.
I checked it out, perused it, then put it aside.
I spent scant time with it, but its basic idea stuck with me.

> The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

The book lists two hundred and fiftythree of these, spanning in scope from regions to rooms and graded with the degree of confidence that the authors have in the solution's immutability.
Despite being defined loosely to allow flexible application, the patterns are also defined concretely, often specified numerically and illustrated with pictures and diagrams.
The patterns are ordered by scale from big to small, but they also contain references that connect them into subnetworks.
Forward references elucidate how larger patterns depend on smaller ones and backreferences contextualize patterns in larger ones.

I find the approach -- flexible, deferential, and associative -- rather appealing.
In fact, the book abides by various principles of {% post_url_with_hover_card my virtual book idea | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %}, namely: multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, and nonmonolithic.
As a big fan of wikis, I'm pleased to read that it inspired the [first online wiki](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/WikiWikiWeb).
And as a programmer, I'm intrigued to learn that it inspired the idea of [software design patterns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Software_design_pattern), which are a useful part of the industry vernacular.

The book is, finally, an inspiration for me to create my own pattern language.
I love interior design, placemaking, vibesetting, and lately I've been thinking about what elements make a homespace great.
I've loved furnishing, laying out, and decorating my apartments, and I look forward to owning a house someday.

### i) a good bed

A full for myself, queen or king if I'm sharing with my wife.
Two pillows for myself.
Fitted sheet and a duvet, no top sheet.
The duvet cover made of a high quality, breathable material in a nice color.
It must have eight ties inside it to keep the duvet in place and a zipper at the bottom hidden behind a flap.
While using the bed, I don't want to notice a separation between the duvet and its cover.

The frame must be sturdy and stable.
No squeaking when getting in and out of bed.

### ii) flat, walk-in shower

I never take baths.
Even when I do, they're not so much a luxury as a trifle.
Showering, on the other hand, is special.
Each day it offers a private respite, and a golden moment when restful relaxation doubles as an invaluable opportunity to {% post_url_with_hover_card listen to your subsconscious | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %}.
And for this moment to flourish fully and consistently, we need the right physical space.

The standard bathtub-shower design seems like a good idea.
Two for the price of one.
But [the compromise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Design_by_committee) at the heart of its design prevents it from being a good shower.
(Or, probably, a good tub, too, but, as I said, I don't have much to say about baths.)
The cost of the compromise is hidden in plain sight, difficult to notice due to its ubiquity.
Allow me to shed some light on the ways that the tub compromises the shower.

To begin with, you can't simply walk into the shower.
You have to _climb_ in, over a literal barrier.
Clearing this hurdle is already an uncomfortable task considering there are no clothes to soften accidental contact, but it's not merely a matter of stepping high and long because on the other side of the barrier one must balance onefooted on ground mutated by the tub from level ground into a skinny ramp with sloping edges.
Sure, it's less hostile than a minefield or a beartrap, but it's shockingly inhospitable considering its primary aim is to allow a bipedal, softskinned animal to stand barefoot while being showered in water (hence the name) and contort while applying lubricants that ooze dangerously downwards onto an already slick slanted surface.
But we're used to it, so we don't notice its unfriendly design.

On the other hand, a shower that does not need to perform as a tub can focus on being a good shower.
It can be easy to enter and to exit.
Its surface does not need to be lowfriction to accommodate a bare backside, it can be tiled or of some other high friction surface that is comfortable to stand on.
It can be wide enough to allow a person to turn their body without grazing against the shower curtain or feeling otherwise constricted.

Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean and lets their mind wander without unwwanted interruption.
To achieve this, it must it extremely easy to do all the basic operations: getting in, standing, washing, rinsing, and getting out.

All this to say, I love walk-in showers.
Bonus points for nice tiles and for a flat entry with no intermediary ledge.

### iii) diffused & ambient lighting

I hate overhead lighting that is bright and direct.
The inconvenience of switching off five lamps in a living room is nothing compared to having to withstand the piercing glare of bare bulbs shining down horribly into my eyes.
For switch-operated room lights, I much prefer track lighting aimed at the wall or lights diffused by rice paper pendants.
The goal is to create a [soup of light](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTsun7JQzd0off7M8o5DlJ983OV63snW?si=xKxDqYwS4oq-6glt).

Also, as per pattern #252, _pools of light_, lights should accentuate or even delineate spaces and subspaces.
Don't just light a whole room, light each space within the room.
And, importantly, "spaces" should be defined by human activity and experience: a private corner where you or your loved ones sit to read, an area where a little group may sit to talk or play games, etc.

### iv) plants

Especially leafy ones.
Pothos, monstera, ficus.
I'm not a huge fan of aloe veras or succulents.
Snake plants are ok.

### v) comfy couch

Whenever I see a home tour on YouTube and it lacks a cushy sofa in the living room, I mourn it.
Armchairs and chairs are not enough.
For me, couches are fundamental.

I am picky how the couch feels to sit on, too.
I think I prefer a slightly low and certainly a deep seat.
Its texture and color matter, too.

Also, see pattern #251, _different chairs_, which provides seating variety to create options for different people or the same people in different moods.

### vi) dishwasher

I don't like to wash dishes by hand.
It takes so long.
And it feels meaningless, unlike other chores, like plant watering.
Plus, I'm prone to excema.

### vii) ample natural light

I need big and many windows.
In the living room, at least, artificial lighting should be optional in the daytime.
Northfacing windowsills (in the northern hemisphere) are fantastic for plants.
Direct sunlight is nice, even if just a little bit.

### viii) coffee setup

Preferrably an espresso machine with a grinder with a portafilter holder.
At least, a pourover setup: a gooseneck kettle, a cone dripper, a scale, and a burr grinder.

### ix) TV with a good sound system

Makes me sad to watch movies on TV speakers.

### x) artwork

On the walls.
Nothing fancy.
Nicelooking stuff and stuff with personal significance (see pattern #253, _things from your life_).
Not generic or massproduced prints.
Trendy interior design brands have ruined Matisse figure prints, at least for a few years.

### xi) desk with a monitor

Preferrably with a big table surface.
Bonus points for a mounted monitor that doesn't take up any deskspace and can be swiveled out of the way.

### xii) nice dishware

I like an assortment of glasses and mugs.
Nice shapes, materials, and weight.
Uniform cutlery.
Matching set of dishes, bowls, and bowl plates.

I don't care for the massproduced mugs, regardless of what image or words are imprinted on them.
I like large handles so that it is easy to hold the mug with one hand without touching or bumping into the hot mug's sidesurface.

### xiii) easy & fast access to street

It's annoying to fish for my keys or a fob to unlock doors.
For that reason, I sometimes prefer parking on the street than in a garage.
In general, I love being able to walk out of my home and virtually straight onto the street.
I like views but they're not worth long elevator waits.
A view of a nice neighborhood street or of leafy trees is enough for me.

### xiv) a place to set things down

I'm a strong believer in having a designated place at the entrance for placing house keys upon entry.
It's convenient for arrival and departure, and it effects a pleasant psychological sensation of transition.
Arriving, it feels nice to unburden oneself of logistical paraphernalia necessary for navigating the world outside, which accentuates the feeling of returning to a place of convenience, comfort, and familiarity.
Departing, it's nice to feel equipped before stepping through the doorway into the world.

After writing the above, I revisited the book.
Thanks to its relative obscurity, the ebook version was available to borrow immediately from the Seattle Public Library.
I'm pleased to find out the authors encourage readers to come up with their own pattern languages.
It occurs to me that some of the my patterns might have some tacit principles in common.
I want to deduce them and make them explicit so I can reference them from relevant patterns and thereby uncover principles that underpin my whole pattern language.

### a) avoid causes of mental clutter & friction

I'm trying to articulate the common principle, assuming there is one, between my preference for (i) a sole duvet and for (ii) a walk-in shower.
In the same way I resent having to think about stepping into a bathtub and about where I step while I shower, I resent having to keep track of a top sheet while in bed.
I much prefer to interact exclusively with the duvet.
I am aware that it sounds contrived or even slightly insane, but these things cause me minor mental friction that I wish I could eliminate in totality.

I think there are many little bits in my patterns that can be traced to my intolerance for mental friction.
My distaste for (xiii) having to unlock doors on my way out of my home or having to wait an indeterminate amount of time for an elevator.
My preference for (xii) big mug handles, so I don't have worry about holding the mug a certain way to avoid burning my knuckles.
Before bluetooth headphones became ubiquitous, wired headphones caused me constant psychological chafe.
I hated having to supervise that pesky dangling cord.
To minimize the probability of it catching on protruding bits, like the jagged knobs of our kitchen cabinets, I used to run the cord up my shirt along my back, out through the neckhole, and into my ears like I was in the secret service.
(This was my variant on the common practice of running headphones under the shirt on the _front_ side, which had the issue that, when not in use, the cord would swing in front of you.)
I bought my first pair of cordless headphones in 2018 and they were a revelation.
The freedom was exquisite.
Nowadays it's easy to take for granted.
