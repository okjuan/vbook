Sometimes, audio is the superior medium.
<!--more-->
It's easy to forget this because audio is often just a supplement or alternative to video.
The audio show [_Random Tape_](https://open.spotify.com/show/6YZiV6je3CH8KWk1TcO8tL?si=306eaafdfacf4135) is a good reminder.
It's a collection of audio recordings that don't have much to do with each other than having all fallen into the hands of man named [David Weinberg](https://www.davidcweinberg.com/about-1).
I cherish it as a testament to the power of pure audio as a medium.

Recently during my routine cleaning of Google storage forced by their 15GB max and my determination to stay in the free tier, I came across a video that was all black.
It was 1 minute and 34 seconds long and had retained its place in my Google Photos purely due to its audio.
I had recorded it purposefully with my phone in my pocket during a recent Christmas trip I took with my mom and younger sister to Puerto Vallarta.
In it you can hear only our voices and the sound of the beach.
So I lifted the audio and scrapped the video, reducing the file's size 100 times.
Here it is:

<div class="audio-container">
    <audio controls>
    <source src="assets/momRecording.puertoVallarta.xmas2021.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
</div>

Inspired, I tried the same for a video I took that same trip of a live band at [River Cafe](https://rivercafe.com.mx/), where we had dinner.
It was blurry, a bit shaky, and not much to look at.
I figured keeping just the audio would be a good compromise.
Footage of the band lost, but their music conserved and in a much smaller file.
But then I listened to it and realized that I liked it _better_ as pure sound.
It wasn't a compromise, it was an improvement.

<div class="audio-container">
    <audio controls>
    <source src="assets/riverCafe.puertoVallarta.xmas2021.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
</div>

Admittedly, part of my satisfaction was in finding an efficient way to conserve the memory without paying for cloud storage.
But I think the audio version _is_ better because it omits sensory details – visual, in this case – that would've otherwise made the moment seem more ordinary.
By making it difficult to know exactly what is going on in the scene, by slightly disorienting the listener, and by forcing them to sharpen their focus on the limited source of sensory information, the audio version heightens the feeling of being transported to a particular place and time.
Feeling around to get a grip on what's going on, you find yourself pulled in.

The art of {% vbook_post creating secondhand experiences | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story %} depends on the omission of details just like it does on their inclusion.
A good writer, a good storyteller, a good filmmaker, good artists of all kinds withhold things from us so that we lean in closer, listen more carefully, read between the lines.
An artist's greatest resource is not words, images, sound, or any of the elements of their craft.
Their greatest resource is the human body, the magnificent biochemical machine wherein all experience real or artifical takes place.
Artists use their own to intuit what stimulus and how much of it will evoke something in their audience's brains and bodies.
And as long as the means and effects of this process cannot be disentangled by clinical observation and deductive reasoning alone, they remain in the domain of art, under the purview of intuition and informal experimentation.

The richness of experience that restrained writing can create is arresting.
Hemingway is a radical example.
His writing is so plain and unadorned that it risks providing too little.
In his memoir _A Moveable Feast_, he tells of "good" wines, "good" cafes, and "very good" novels.
Isn't his job as a writer to unpack what it is that makes things good?

A writer creates meaning in collaboration with the reader by directing their attention.
They curate bits of experience and bring them into sensory focus so that the reader notices them and their effects on their mind and body.
Insufficent information renders a blurry image, but so does excess.
Making art is in part an act of calibration.
The writer's job isn't to explain experience, but to {% vbook_post cause it | 2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing %}.
