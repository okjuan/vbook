Interesting assumptions underlie the belief that a city is "too expensive."
<!--more-->
Too expensive for whom?
The first groups that come to mind for me now are minimum wage workers and those who work essential jobs in domains like health care and education.
These are people we rely on for the functioning of our city.
That they must commute into it because the cost of living is too high is an ugly notion.
It disquiets the conscience.
It feels wrong.

Here already we are at a point of divergence.
Not everyone will agree that those whose work sustains city life should have option of sustainable life in the city themselves.
Only the most individualistic (and probably the most wealthy) would dismiss this concern outright.
Many more would say that yes, _ideally_, the city should be affordable to those who keep it running.
However, many of these people balk as soon as the proposed solution involves new apartment buildings near their single family home.

At public hearings held by the Vancouver City Council for rezoning applications under consideration, this cohort is consistently represented by a small group of locals who decry towers and "all the misery [they rain down] on neighborhoods."
They deploy arguments with as much moral thrust as they can muster.
Towers inflate property value.
Their rent is too high.
They block views and cast shadows.
They are a bad fit for the neighborhood, a violation of its character.
They belong downtown.

But how else are we to make the city affordable to more people?
The proposed towers are part of a longterm, comprehensive plan to extend Vancouver's downtown two kilometers south, which is underpinned by the ongoing construction of the Broadway subway.
Accordingly, housing density in the area must rise drastically from its glaringly outdated levels.
How else can that be achieved if not with towers?
Would these defenders of neighborhood disruption suggest that density be realized horizontally by evicting contiguous rows of single family homes?
Of course not.

The highest ideal held by this group – the ideal they don't just claim, but actually try to effect – is conservatism.
Some of them call themselves "urbanists" and extol all the wonders of city life – walkability, public spaces, parks, village high streets – and yet they rage against the metamorphic growth inherent to a thriving city.
No doubt they sympathize with those who are priced out, but this conviction figures low in esteem compared to their aversion to change in their neighborhood.
But what is a city to do when molting season comes?
