I began with this sentence:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to become not only natively proficient in Spanish and English, but also multicultural.
<!--more-->

But I felt something was slightly off with "but also multicultural."
It's hard to figure out exactly what I didn't like about it.
Maybe its meaning was too opaque?
Or the proportions of "natively proficient in Spanish and English" compared to "multicultural" were awkwardly lopsided?

Whatever the reason, I rewrote it as this:

> Due to these opportunities in my early life, I am natively proficient in Spanish and English, and culturally embedded in multiple contexts.

Immediately, I disliked the "Due to" construction, so I wrote a third version:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for multiple cultural contexts.

I prefer the latest version because it connects cause and effect using verbs rather than with logical statement.
Specifically, to express the causal relationship between the "opportunities in my early life" and my consequent skills, the third version uses the verbs "allowed me to develop" rather than the more abstract, logical connecting bits "Due to" and "I am" of the second version. 
The reader _sees_ the relationship directly in the sentence without having to translate it from a logical statement.

I realize this might sound like nitpicky minutiae.
But I think there is an effective difference in _immediacy of meaning_ here.
By writing "Due to X..." a writer signals to the reader that they must remember "X" until its promised role is revealed.
Until that promise is fulfilled, the reader may have to digest bits of information related to "X" and its yet unknown role, all the while maintaining "X" in working memory.
This is an unnecessary chore that writers should avoid putting onto the reader.

The final problem I tried to fix was the potential buzzwordiness of "an intuition for multiple cultural contexts."
I think multicultural people would likely grasp what I mean, but it's not very concrete and could invite cynical dismissal as a non-statement.
I tried this:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition that allows me to inhabit multiple cultural contexts.

But was yet unsatisfied.
It sounds like something someone writes about themselves on their resume or LinkedIn profile.
Still too abstract to be trusted as referring to something real.
So I tried to get specific:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for cultural subtleties that differ across the US, Mexico, and Canada.

Now we're getting more concrete.
Part of the solution is simply to name the specific countries I'm referring to.
This avoids suggesting I could fit into any culture in the world, which would dilute the substance of my statement and tempt readers to distrust it altogether.
I think the phrase "cultural subtleties" also helps despite still being somewhat abstract because it is suggestive of specific things that people experience in daily life, like social cues.
It is general yet concrete by virtue of {% vbook_post evoking a distinct mental sensation | 2024-11-28-write-concretely %}.
