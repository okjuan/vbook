I began with this sentence:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to become not only natively proficient in Spanish and English, but multicultural.
<!--more-->

I've come to realize that I reach for the "not only...but also" tool a lot.
It's an issue not only of repetitiveness but also of increased distance between "become" and "multicultural."
This combined with the lopsided proportions of "natively proficient in Spanish and English" compared to "multicultural" undermines the goal of emphasizing "multicultural" by depicting it as an afterthought.

Did you notice I used "not only...but also" again two sentences ago?
I think it works there because the first object "repetitiveness" takes up little space and thus concedes the ground for emphasis to "increased distance between the intial verb and its second object."
In contrast, "natively proficient in Spanish and English" is huge compared to "multicultural."

So I rewrote it as this:

> Due to these opportunities in my early life, I am natively proficient in Spanish and English, and culturally embedded in multiple contexts.

Immediately, I wrote a third version that looked like this:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for multiple cultural contexts.

Both of these versions solve the "not only...but also" problem of disproportion, but I prefer the latest version because it connects cause and effect with verbs rather than with logical statement.
Specifically, the third version uses pleasing, active verbs "allowed me to develop" rather than the more abstract, logical connecting bits "Due to" and "I am" of the second version to describe the causal relationship.
The reader _sees_ the relationship directly in the sentence without having to decode it from the logical statement.

I realize this might sound like nitpicky minutiae.
But I think there is an effective difference in _immediacy of meaning_ here.
By writing "Due to X..." a writer signals to the reader that they must store "X" until its promised role is revealed.
Until that promise is fulfilled, the reader may have to digest bits of information related to "X" and its yet unknown role, all the while maintaining "X" in working memory.
This is an unpleasant chore that writers should avoid putting onto the reader.

The final problem I tried to fix was the potential buzzwordiness "an intuition for multiple cultural contexts."
I think multicultural people would likely grasp what I mean, but it is not very concrete and could invite cynical dismissal as a non-statement.
I tried this:

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition that allows me to inhabit multiple cultural contexts.

But was yet unsatisfied.
Still too abstract to be trusted as referring to something real.

> These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for cultural subtleties that differ across the US, Mexico, and Canada.

Now we're getting more concrete.
Part of the solution is simply to name the specific countries I'm referring to.
This avoids seeming like I think I could fit into any culture in the world, which would dilute the substance of my statement and tempt readers to distrust it altogether.
I think the phrase "cultural subtleties" also helps because, while it is still somewhat abstract, it is suggestive of specific things like social cues, which people experience in daily life.
It is concrete by virtue of {% vbook_post evoking a distinct mental sensation | 2024-11-28-write-concretely %}.
