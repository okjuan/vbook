### Life

My weight loss progress has slowed.
I'm going to be patient and keep working on small, daily habits that have worked so far.
Playing soccer, going for walks, eating vegetables, eating more slowly and mindfully, and not finishing my serving just because it's served.

After a month of not playing soccer, I was excited to get back on the pitch.
At my first game back, there was a middle-aged man {% post_url_with_hover_card recording the game | 2024-01-31-man-with-a-custom-tripod %} from the sidelines with a camera mounted on a tall tripod.
Only a few weeks ago I was wishing I had videos of my matches from years past.
Since watching this recent one, I've been working on moving off the ball better.
Adjust my position in anticipation of where the ball will be next.

I still haven't gone snowboarding this season, but I went with Z, Z's mom, and Z's stepdad to {% post_url_with_hover_card Harrison Hot Springs | 2024-02-01-hot-springs %}.
The Vancouver area is stunning after a good snow.
The hills speckled with evergreen and white, and the snow-capped mountains beyond.
We stopped at Bridal Veil Falls on the way back.
They were frozen solid, it was a sight.

Z won tickets for Canucks vs Blackhawks from a raffle at work, so we went to our first ever {% post_url_with_hover_card Canucks game | 2024-02-03-hockey-game %}.
It was novel for me.
The only sport I watch regularly is soccer.
I've been watching all of [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/)'s games.
It's been really interesting to observe Mikel Arteta build and develop his team.
His tactics and strategies are pretty complex and they evolve constantly.
There's a hilarious moment in an interview from a few months ago in which a reporter asks him about the new formation he is using and he replies that his team used "36 different structures" in the game and he had no idea which formation the reporter meant.
So far, his system has been working and adapting well.

### Work

Took a few weeks to get back into the groove.
My mind started running wild.
What if I went to grad school?
I got my calm back when I got more interesting tasks to do.
I've been almost two years working on Loop and I can see myself continuing for another year at least.
It's the best job I've ever had.

### Coding

I revamped the design of my app [**Muze Radio**](https://okjuan.me/muze-radio).
Still waiting to hear back from Spotify regarding my request for an [extended quota](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/rate-limits), which would allow any Spotify Premium user to use my app.
I submitted it back on January 9th and the expected turnaround time of six weeks has now elapsed.
Hopefully they'll get back to me this week.

I started working on [hoverbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverbox) previews for this site.
I want them to look like the previews on Wikipedia or [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX).
I'm excited.

### Reading

I've been reading a lot lately.
I have about a dozen books on the go.

I sped through {% post_url_with_hover_card _Stella Maris_ | 2024-01-15-stella-maris %} in a few days and now I'm reading [_The Passenger_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60581087-the-passenger).
Cormac McCarthy's last two novels.
A lot of what Alicia says in _Stella Maris_ Cormac himself says in [this interview](https://youtu.be/HrUy1Vn2KdI?si=_PEWEy--HIZMe8FW), e.g. the subsconscious is "a machine for operating an animal."

I'm two thirds into _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_.
I'm taking my time, letting the ideas sink in, and observing their relevance to Seattle and Vancouver.

In the background, I'm reading a couple books that lend themselves to slow incremental consumption.
{% post_url_with_hover_card _The Relationship Handbook_ | 2024-01-20-good-relationships %} and Italo Calvino's [_Mr. Palomar_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/340940.Mr_Palomar).
I was ready to ditch the latter but on a whim I gave it another shot and loved chapter five, _The blackbird's whistle_.
I intend to post about it on this site at some point.

Meanwhile, I've been listening to David Lynch's biography-memoir [_Room to Dream_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35224286-room-to-dream) and [Mary Norris's memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622752-between-you-me?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=o3BPxB5Foi&rank=1) about working at the New Yorker.

Flirting with starting [_Circe_](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circe_(novel)), one of Z's favorite books.
I've put _Infinite Jest_ on probation.
I feel neither compelled to commit nor ready to ditch.

Also reading New Yorker articles here and there.
[What the Doomsayers Get Wrong About Deepfakes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-history-of-fake-things-on-the-internet-walter-j-scheirer-book-review) makes a good point: new technology rarely aligns with our panicked predictions of catastrophe but often inflicts harm more insidiously and narrowly.
[This article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/01/has-gratuity-culture-reached-a-tipping-point) about tipping -- originally "To Insure Promptitude" -- was really interesting.
And [this one](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/01/american-poly-christopher-gleason-book-review-more-a-memoir-of-open-marriage-molly-roden-winter) about polyamory's popularity.
Finally, [this one](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/when-philosophers-become-therapists) about the "philosophical-counselling movement."

A guy from my high school posted [an insightful mini-essay](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2IJF3ELoep/?img_index=1) about how social media robs us of precious "idle time."
Reminds me of the concept of "ambient thought" and the ideas in {% post_url_with_hover_card this mini-essay | 2023-12-05-where-ideas-come-from-2 %} that I posted on this site.

I've also spent more time reading articles published on smaller profile websites.
Some really good pieces about software:
[An App Can Be A Home-Cooked Meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), about programming as a practical skill for use in personal life.
[The Rise of "Worse is Better"](https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html), about a counterintuitive yet effective approach to buidling software.
Reminds me of [Skateboard, Bike, Car](https://awilkinson.medium.com/skateboard-bike-car-6bec841ed96e), which I've mentioned before.
Finally, [Situated Software](https://web.archive.org/web/20050120085129/http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html), about another counterintuitive software development philosophy: built to **not** scale.

### Writing

{% post_url_with_hover_card Book | 2024-01-15-stella-maris %} and {% post_url_with_hover_card movie | 2024-01-18-elephant-man %} reviews, {% post_url_with_hover_card vign | 2024-02-01-hot-springs %}{% post_url_with_hover_card ettes | 2024-02-03-hockey-game %}, {% post_url_with_hover_card notes | 2024-01-20-good-relationships %}, and a couple of {% post_url_with_hover_card mini-essays | 2024-02-03-what-are-rules %}, including {% post_url_with_hover_card how to use restraint | 2024-02-04-use-restraint %}, which I plan to revise because I lost sight of my point towards the end.

### TV

_The Wire_, seasons one and two, some of the third.
A reminder of several depressing facts of American life: police brutality, perverted hierarchical bureacracies ("Chain of command!"), the ravage of drugs in poor communities.
One of the great things about this show is its multitude of characters and lack of a permanent protagonist.
Another is the show's vividness.
The shipyard and its workers in the second season feel so real.

Season one of _True Detective_.
Really interesting character foil.
I think Lynch would adore the concept of The Taxman, the detective that carries around a surprisingly large notebook and bears his duties like a holy burden.
Does not believe in Christ but hangs a crucifix in his apartment to contemplate "that moment in the garden."
The Taxman is at the center of an aesthetically breathtaking action scene in Episode four.
Not surprised to see a lot of talk about it online, e.g. [Breaking Down the Best Scene in True Detective](https://youtu.be/twzgzPzf-TU?si=AXJYLop_eSqO_vv8).

Rewatching _Arrested Development_, again.
Still catching some jokes for the first time.
Also watching the new season of [_The Eric Andre Show_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eric_Andre_Show).

### Movies

[Anatomy of a Fall](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Anatomy_of_a_Fall) was fantastic.
Two and a half hours long but engaging all the way through.
A lot of dialogue.
Beautiful to look at.

[Talk to Me](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Talk_to_Me_(2022_film)) was also very good.
It's now one of my favorite horror movies.
Reminds me of [Insidious](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Insidious_(film)) for obvious reasons and [Hereditary](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hereditary_(film)) for more subtle ones.

### What's next?

Work.

Keep playing soccer, going on walks, resume bike riding.
Go snowboarding!

Keep reading, keep writing.

Continue working on **Muze Radio**.
Implement hoverbox previews on this site.

Plan this year's trips with Z.

Going to an improv class for the first time.
Z signed us up after doing one with friends recently.
She thinks I'm going to love it.

Continue nurturing my social life in Vancouver.
Play chess and watch Lynch movies with friends.

Keep watching Arsenal games.
It will be thrilling to see how the rest of the season plays out.
It's so tight at the top.
Hopefully Arsenal will still be up there next time I write a personal update.

Super excited to see Ethiopian keyboardist [Hailu Mergia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hailu_Mergia) in Seattle with my friend, who is also Ethiopian.
I might go to a couple other live shows, too.

I'm looking forward to it all.
Things are good and spring is coming.
