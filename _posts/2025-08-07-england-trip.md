Before we settled on Bristol, Z and I considered visiting Liverpool.
When I noticed that Wrexham was nearby, I fancied a day trip down to see them play their first ever(?) Championship match at the Racecourse, or at least to grab a pint at The Turf and meet Wayne, the charming bar owner and Wrexham A.F.C. devotee.
I just realized he reminds me of Karl Pilkington.
Agh, I'm almost regretting not pursuing this plan.
Commute from Bristol to Wrexham would be long and I can't imagine tickets would be cheap to get, if any were available at all.
I suppose it might still be worth it if I can watch the game at The Turf.
We'll see.
Z won't be thrilled with the idea, but the 16th is my birthday and for it she'll do whatever possible to make me happy.
I'm a lucky guy.
