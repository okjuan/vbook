#### Friday 08/15/2025 -- Bristol

- arrive in Bristol Airport in the evening, take Uber to Airbnb in Montpelier
- eat late dinner @ Nadu (really good)
- shower and go to bed before midnight

Before we settled on Bristol, Z and I considered visiting Liverpool.
When I noticed that Wrexham was nearby, I fancied a day trip down to see them play their first ever(?) Championship match at the Racecourse, or at least to grab a pint at The Turf and meet Wayne, the charming bar owner and Wrexham A.F.C. devotee.
I just realized he reminds me of Karl Pilkington.
Agh, I'm almost regretting not pursuing this plan.
Commute from Bristol to Wrexham would be long and I can't imagine tickets would be cheap to get, if any were available at all.
I suppose it might still be worth it if I can watch the game at The Turf.
We'll see.
Z won't be thrilled with the idea, but the 16th is my birthday and for it she'll do whatever possible to make me happy.
I'm a lucky guy.

Our {% vbook_post time in the Irish countryside | 2025-08-07-ireland-trip %} was fantastic.
There we found the conventional tourist attractions well worth seeing.
It is making me reflect on cities and what about them makes them worth visiting.
Good food of diverse types.
Art shows like galleries, live music, and stand up comedy.
Historical landmarks and notable architecture.

A remarkable aspect of a good city is its density.
I think I have to shift my mindset.
Here it isn't about covering ground but about drilling down in single spots.
Spending hours at a museum.
Eating a great dinner in a restaurant mere steps from another where you had breakfast.
Even returning to the same restaurant to try different items on the menu.
Doing these things feel less like exploring and adventuring.

I can't help but chuckle to myself sitting here on my first train trip in England.
The platform was occupied with travelers waiting for the train and when it arrived everyone flocked to the carriage entrances.
Z and I were confused to see everyone standing so close to the doors before they opened.
Wouldn't there be people on the train already, some of whom would be disembarking here in Bristol?
Indeed there were.
The doors opened and people started trickling out, many with luggage and one with a stroller and yet the travelers waiting to board barely made way for them.
Z and I looked at each other.

Once we got on the train, we waited for people in front of us to stow luggage and find seats.
The seats were mostly occupied but we saw a few single open seats remaining so we stepped down the aisle towards them.
Nearest us there appeared to be two single seats open at either side of the aisle but when I came to what would be mine I discovered a small dog panting where he lay before a bowl of water.
I considered asking for the seat but then there were more open seats down the aisle.
Still it felt funny to give deference to a dog.
I turned to the other side of the aisle and asked the girl if she'd mind moving her luggage from the seat next to her.
To my and Z's surprise she replied that she did mind, that she had documents in her suitcase.
I said _Oh, you can't put it there?_ pointing overhead.
She said _No, it doesn't fit._
Two dreadful excuses.
Z and I looked at each other again, mutual incredulity growing.
No matter, ahead were more open seats.

A woman with a baby strapped to her chest asked me for help putting her stroller in the overhead compartment.
I did and as she turned to get in her seat the backpack on her back touched the face of a middleaged man sitting across the aisle and he moaned and clutched his nose as if he'd been struck.
The mother turned to him and said _I'm so sorry, are you ok?_ with all the polite concern in her tone of voice but none much on her face.
The man didn't look at her anyway — he was still holding his face — and he waved her away and said _Just sit down_.
The mother exchanged silent looks with us and sat down.

As Z and I lurched down the aisle of the moving train towards the few remaining empty seats, nobody made to remove their bags from their adjacent seat to allow us it.
Each of us had to walk up to a passenger, look them in the face, and ask that they make their spare seat available to us.
An opportunity to interact more with the locals I suppose.

We've been getting around on dott scooters.
Bristol is not huge.
The best ways for us to get around have been walking, biking, and scootering.
We haven't taken the bus yet because it's rarely a convenient option.
