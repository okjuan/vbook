The standard bathtub-shower design seems like a good idea.

Two in one.
But [the compromise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Design_by_committee) at the heart of its design prevents it from being a good shower.
The cost of the compromise is hidden in plain sight, difficult to notice due to its ubiquity.
Allow me to shed some light on the ways that the tub compromises the shower.

We begin with the uncomfortable task of having to _climb_ in, over a literal barrier, without any clothes to soften accidental contact.
Clearing this hurdle is not merely a matter of stepping high and long because on the other side one must balance onefooted on a skinny, slippery ramp with sloping edges.
It's shockingly inhospitable ground considering its primary aim is to allow a bipedal, softskinned animal to stand barefooted in showering water and contort while applying lubricants that ooze dangerously downwards onto an already slick surface.
But we're used to this design, so we don't notice its baffling unfriendliness.

If freed from the responsibility of doubling as a tub, a shower can focus on being a good shower.
It can be easy to enter and to exit.
Its standing ground, unobliged to accommodate the bare backside, can be tiled or otherwise surfaced with material that gives traction to the bare foot, even when covered in soapy water.
The dimensions can be square and wide enough to allow a person to turn and easily rinse different parts of their body without having to watch their step or feel unreasonably constricted.

Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean while {% vbook_post their mind wanders | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %}.
To achieve this, it must make it extremely easy to do all the basic things: get in, stand, wash, rinse, and get out.
The tubshower hybrid most of us have at home fails this basic test.
