This site -- [okjuan.me/vbook](https://okjuan.me/vbook) -- contains all my public writing.

My [original idea]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-02-25-come.up.with.ideas %}) for it was to gather all my essays to create a wikipedia-like experience.
Then I realized I should loosen the restriction on form and build a vaster network of ideas, one that may include notes, reviews, journal entries, poems, stories, pictures, videos, audio, or any form that is yet to occur to me or anyone else.

You can think of this site as a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), but I hope it becomes a good example of what I call a [virtual book]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-08-11-virtual-book %}).
