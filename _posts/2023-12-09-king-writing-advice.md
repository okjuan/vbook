King's advice is mostly for fiction, but some of it applies to non-fiction, too.

### big picture

Read a lot.
Four hours per day.
Take one day off per week, if you must.

Write a lot.
The same number of pages every day.
Don't stop until you're done, even on slow days.

### technical stuff

Don't describe too much.
Depict a scene with a few, vivid details.
Let the reader's imagination dictate what characters look like.
Let context tell the reader how characters are acting.
Avoid adverbs like the plague.

Use simple verbs.
Use "said" for dialogue attribution.

Work hard on your dialogue.
Make it as true as possible.

Learn grammar.
Grow your vocabulary.

### writing process

Don't come up with the plot of your story, {% vbook_post discover it | 2023-12-09-on-writing %}.
Start with an interesting situation.
Put your character in it and see how they react.

After you finish your first draft, put it away.
Work on other things for some time.
Resist the temptation to go back and see if that inspired passage really is brilliant.
Or if that other chunk needs work.
Wait.

This is a fertile time to work on something else, a short story, an article, something unrelated.

After a few weeks, when you're ready to write a second draft, take the first draft out of the drawer.
Wielding a pen and the critical distance you developed by waiting, go to work.
Read the whole thing in the fewest possible sessions, marking the draft with notes of the things that must change.

The whole process should take three or four drafts.
The final one should be more compact, not longer than the first one.

Write for your Ideal Reader: a single person (or persona), whose tastes you aim to please.
Get feedback on your draft from a few, trusted people.
Listen to them, but also listen to your gut.
