We should also fight the urge to read books quickly.
If a book grabs your attention and pulls you in, go ahead.
But don't hurry through sentences to make your reading session feel more productive.
Read a chunk and consider what you're getting out of it.
If there's nothing to digest, then why are you reading it?

We forget much of what we read.
The lessons books teach us are hard to recall on command.
We are painfully reminded of this every time we try to summarize a book in conversation with someone.
But this doesn't mean that we gained nothing.
The lessons get translated and encoded into our thought process.
We incorporate them into our habits, our beliefs.

This happens easily when something we read rouses our curiosity.
We compare it with things we know.
We notice how it differs.
We ask follow-up questions.
We imagine new things.

By slowing down, we encourage more of these interactions.
If you watch yourself while you read, you can see how much attention you're actually paying.
You can catch yourself tuning out even as the words still shove through your mind.

Even a great book will lose you at some point.
A person can only read for so long.
Put the book down and think about what you just read.
Imagine how to apply what you just learned.
How you already do it, or why it wouldn't work.
