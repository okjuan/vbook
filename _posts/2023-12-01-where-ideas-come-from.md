Don't come up with the plot of your story, says Stephen King.

> Plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible.

The plot isn't yours to invent.
It's yours to discover:

> My basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow, and to transcribe them of course...I believe stories are found things, like fossils in the ground...Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered, pre-existing world. The writer's job is to use the tools...to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible.

Other prolific writers agree.
David Lynch fishes his ideas out of the depths of his subconscious:

> Ideas are like fish. You don't make the fish, you catch the fish.

Or in the words of [Cormac McCarthy](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/cormac-and-sfi-abiding-friendship):

> Writing is like taking dictation.

On this topic, Karl Pilkington echoes both McCarthy...

> If you just talk, I find that your mouth...comes out with stuff.

And King:

> If you sit there and try and use your brain to do it, it doesn't work the same. Just -- just keep talking, just keep your -- keep your -- keep your mouth talking...and eventually, it will come out with something pretty good.

If what these accomplished men say is true and we don't come up with our own ideas... [who does?]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2021-02-01-think-invisibly %})
