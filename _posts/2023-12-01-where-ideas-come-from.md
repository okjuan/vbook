Don't come up with the plot of your story, {% post_url_with_hover_card says Stephen King | 2023-12-09-on-writing %}.

> Plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible.

The plot isn't yours to invent.
It's yours to discover:

> My basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow, and to transcribe them of course...I believe stories are found things, like fossils in the ground...Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered, pre-existing world. The writer's job is to use [their] tools...to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible.

Other prolific writers agree.
David Lynch fishes his ideas out of the depths of his subconscious:

> Ideas are like fish. You don't make the fish, you catch the fish.

Or in the words of [Cormac McCarthy](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/cormac-and-sfi-abiding-friendship):

> Writing is like taking dictation.

On this topic, Karl Pilkington echoes both McCarthy and King:

> If you just talk, I find that your mouth...comes out with stuff.
>
> If you sit there and try and use your brain to do it, it doesn't work the same. Just -- just keep talking, just keep your -- keep your -- keep your mouth talking...and eventually, it will come out with something pretty good.

If what these accomplished men say is true and we don't come up with our own ideas... {% post_url_with_hover_card who does? | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %}
