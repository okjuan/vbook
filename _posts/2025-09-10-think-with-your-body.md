I like doing laundry.
<!--more-->
Like showering, it's a task that requires no special effort.
You do it idly and you always succeed at it, and in the meantime your mind is free to wander.

When the washing machine finishes its cycle, I take my freshly laundered clothes to the spare bedroom for hanging up.
I hangdry my clothes to avoid the damage dryers do.
I hang one article of clothing at a time, balancing each one in its own section of the drying rack and then stretching it gently to allow for quicker drying.
The socks I hang in the little slots that exist for them at both ends of the rack.
I take my time.
Hurry would save an insignificant amount of time at the cost of the unnecessary stress that fuels urgency.
And I enjoy the process anyway, so I partake in it mindfully.

This ordinary little ritual bestows on each article of clothing a brief but special moment of attention.
During this act of care I find in myself arising a feeling of affection for my clothes.
They are for me and I take care of them and because of that they last longer and while they do I continue to enjoy and care for them.
Because I value them, to hanging them up I dedicate time and attention which in turn reaffirms their value in my esteem.

How I perceive my things determines how I interact with them.
But the reverse is also true.
How I interact with them recasts my perception of them.
These two tiny processes link together into selfsustaining loops.
Positives loops and negatives ones as well.

Perception varies drastically depending on the kind of attention that carries it.
{% vbook_post To perceive something new, we must loosen our attention. | 2021-04-25-work %}
Mindless tasks like showering and doing laundry are {% vbook_post perfect for this | 2024-12-22-ecologies-of-attention-2 %}.
A wandering mind picks up fresh leads, it notices subtle things like my quiet feeling of affection.
To perceive at all, we cannot be distracted.

Digital screens make it so difficult to remain engaged with the people sitting next to you because they interrupt steady attention before it can develop in its own time.
And when a screen is not already {% vbook_post on the wall of the room we're in | 2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention %} – be it in a private home or a [public house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub) – we produce them from our pocket.
We do so not despite but _because_ we know it will distract us.
In idleness our minds begin to wander and we sense it intuitively and cut off the stream of thought before it leads us into the whitewaters of anxiety.
And it works.
We interact with our device, perceive through it like a digital telescope something novel and remote, and find our attention thankfully diverted.
We don't engage with our negative thoughts.
We don't engage with idle thoughts at all.

But idle thoughts are pending items {% vbook_post our subconscious brings to us | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %} for our consideration.
We may reject them, but they will return.
And when they do, we repeat our defense.
A negative loop.

To care about something we must pay attention to it.
Ignoring our thoughts is selfneglect.
One way to engage safely with thoughts that seem too intense to handle is to use your body.
Don't just sit there and think.
Move.
Alleviate some of the emotional burden of confronting your thoughts by diverting some of your attention.
Interact physically with the world.
Play a sport, play a game, go for a walk, wash dishes, do laundry.
Don't just go on your phone.
