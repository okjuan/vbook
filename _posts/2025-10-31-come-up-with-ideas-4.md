Pay attention as you go through life and collect all the curiosities the tides of fortune deposit into your path.
Then just put them in your work when the rightsized hole gapes.

I did this while writing [The Virtual Book](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360).
I suppose it shows, the hodgepodge it is.
It's not the easiest thing to pull off.
But when you do, it gives dimension to your work.
Instead of giving your audience a line to trace from start to end, you put in their hands a knot to pick at, an object to turn over and examine.

A master of embedding meaning in enigma is David Lynch.
His work is rife with bizarre and baffling elements that entreat contemplation but promise no easy translation.
And as he has told in numerous interviews and written in his books, he doesn't come up with his ideas, he _receives_ them.
_Lost Highway_, his neo-noir film from 1997, begins with a cryptic message murmured into the protagonist's intercom.
**Dick Laurent is dead.**
This message came to Lynch not from the depths of his subconscious mind but from his own intercom.
Puzzled, Lynch went to the window to try to get a look at the speaker but he struggled to get a view of the front of his house from inside.
For the film, Lynch bought a house and reconfigured the inside to reenact this whole scenario.
He plucked this strange moment from his personal experience and grafted it onto a film inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial, another event that he was compelled to translate into art.

Lynch is no doubt an eccentric.
But this process of {% vbook_post curating and appropriating from real life | 2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2 %} is so common among artists I dare call it standard practice.
Kurt Vonnegut writes in the prologue to _Breakfast of Champions_ that the book "is a sidewalk strewn with trash" that resulted from his attempt to empty his mind "of all the junk in there."
Paul Harding, whose debut novel _Tinkers_ won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, describes the positive version of this in [his interview with David Perell](https://youtu.be/roLRPQPQU58?si=8azqvMoN7Jksu4ti):

> I'll go for months on end where to all appearances I'm napping on the couch...but I'm always reading, I've got books all over the place and I'm reading a little bit of this, a little bit of that...and I'll just spend time letting the language, the books, and the music that I'm [consuming]...become coextensive....and I just let it kind of all go into the pot.

He opens up his mind and fills it, {% vbook_post consuming in preparation to produce | 2021-04-25-work %}.
He lets the ideas "percolate and simmer together" – as he said in [another interview](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/features/paul-harding-interview-this-other-edenfsudd) – and then, when his [internal milieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_environment) shifts him into motion, he "rides the updraft."

> I let everything I'm interested in at the moment I'm writing into the book...If it all comes from my mind and I'm interested in all of it, it is going to be like a stand of Aspen trees...Aspen trees look like they're different trees, but actually they all have the same root system, it's actually one organism...I love having a bunch of stuff that's just floating around in a manuscript for years and I'm like, I have _no_ idea how you belong but I think you do.

That last bit is important.
This is not an arbitrary process.
It relies on intuition to determine where an element belongs, even if how or why it belongs remains a mystery.

I don't contend this approach is a necessary one, but it's one I like.
It produces art that feels organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, alive.
It favors intuition and its riches over rational cohesion and its reducibility.
It's a method for developing in different directions at once.
Sometimes you get lost but that can be a good thing.
I love art of this kind for the same reason I love jazz.
So many interesting things are happening all the time.
