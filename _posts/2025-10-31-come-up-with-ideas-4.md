Go through life paying attention and collect all the oddities the tides of fortune carry into your path as you drift through the expanse.

Then just put them in your work when the rightsized hole gapes.

I did this while writing [The Virtual Book](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360).
I suppose it shows, the hodgepodge it is.
It's not the easiest thing to pull off.
But when you do it expands your work in dimension.
Instead of giving your audience a line to trace from start to point to point to end, you entangle them in a web of ideas and draw their attention to the meaningful ways they come into contact.
Several lines of thought intersect in an intricate nexus and then they go off and point each in their own tangential direction worth pursuing.
That's how it is in reality anyhow.

David Lynch's enigmatic _Lost Highway_ begins with a cryptic message murmured into the protagonist's intercom.
_Dick Laurent is dead._
This message came to Lynch not from the depths of his subconscious mind but from his own intercom.
Puzzled, Lynch tried to get a look at the speaker but he struggled to get a view of the front of his house from any of the windows.
For the film, Lynch bought a house and reconfigured the inside to reenact this whole scenario.
The movie was not about himself, but he plucked this strange moment from his personal experience and grafted it onto a film inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial, another event that he was compelled to translate into art.

Lynch is no doubt an eccentric but {% vbook_post curated appropriation from real life | 2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2 %} seems to be a common practice among artists.
Paul Harding, whose debut novel _Tinkers_ won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, tells in [this interview](https://youtu.be/roLRPQPQU58?si=8azqvMoN7Jksu4ti) that he likes to insert into his work the things he is interested in at the time of writing.

> I let everything I'm interested in at the moment I'm writing into the book...If it all comes from my mind and I'm interested in all of it, it is going to be like a stand of Aspen trees...Aspen trees look like they're different trees, but actually they all have the same root system, it's actually one organism...I love having a bunch of stuff that's just floating around in a manuscript for years and I'm like, I have _no_ idea how you belong but I think you do.
