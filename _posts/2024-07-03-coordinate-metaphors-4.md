In her [New Yorker article about suspense](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/the-secrets-of-suspense), Kathryn Schulz uses a clever image to describe how suspense exists at many scales.

This immediately conjures the kaleidoscopic image of triangles containing triangles containing triangles, ad infinitum.
A neat way to depict something that occurs at the biggest scale as well as the most minute.

She continues:

> it can be fostered at every level, from a seven-season TV series all the way down to a chapter, a paragraph, a scene, or even a silence.

Again, neat work.
She applies the image of fractals onto her subject, suspense in storytelling.

There is one detail that bugs me, though.
The word **fostered**.
It's not the right word.
How does one foster a fractal?

I think the clash of images is more noticeable when read all together:

> Suspense does not derive only from the machinations of plot. Instead, it is what you might call fractal: it can be fostered at every level, from a seven-season TV series all the way down to a chapter, a paragraph, a scene, or even a silence.

Some alternatives that come to mind are **replicated**, and **reproduced**.
But a simple **applied** will serve as well:

> Suspense does not derive only from the machinations of plot. Instead, it is what you might call fractal: it can be applied at every level, from a seven-season TV series all the way down to a chapter, a paragraph, a scene, or even a silence.

Not perfect, but better than **fostered**, I reckon.
