I've {% vbook_post written before | 2024-02-03-what-are-rules %} about rules in games and the motivations behind their implementation.

In the last few months, I've come across more examples.

While watching the Netflix docuseries [_Losers_](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Losers_(TV_series)), I learned that there is a rule in the game of curling called the [free guard zone](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Curling#Free_guard_zone) that was implemented in the 90s to make illegal the highly effective but boring strategy that [Pat Ryan](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Pat_Ryan_(curler)) and his team employed to win multiple championships.

While listening to the audiobook [_Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3621358-inverting-the-pyramid), I learned that various rules of modern soccer were put in place to prevent certain tactics.
Goalies used to be allowed to use their hands anywhere on the field, a fact which a Sunderland keeper exploited to bounce the ball halfway up the field.
The offside rule used to require attackers to stay in front of or in line with not just two but _three_ defensive players.
In fact, the offside rule used to apply to the whole field, not just the attacking half.
Together, these two archaic rules used to make it very difficult for teams in a defensive position to break out into attack.
