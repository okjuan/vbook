I read a chunk of this.

The interviews with kids about how they understand death is really interesting.
The essays in the first section of the book, like the one by Jung, are intriguing and thought-provoking though sometimes a bit hard to believe.

Jung's novel idea of "fear of life" that contrasts with the familiar "fear of death" is a great one.
But then his idea that life's purpose is death because it is the natural end to its trajectory is dubious if poetic.

There's also an essay that talks about life spaces or something like that.
It's like an unnecessarily technical version of Gail Sheehy's Passages.

I also enjoyed the critique of Heidegger's perverse approach to philosophy.
I thought it was funny and precise.
