This morning I almost got overwhelmed with things I had to do.
A surging feeling like the water line in a glass set down too hard rising to the rim menacingly.

I took a deep breath and I wrote down my chores.
Things I had to do at work, things I had to do for my upcoming wedding, and things I had to do to enjoy Toronto, where I am for the week.
Each of these categories overflows with things I could do, as I guess any category does.
I wrote only a few things per category and recognized immediately that this was the whole day ahead of me.
If I completed everything on the list, I would have good reason to be pleased.
And yet there was so little on it.

I recoil with something like disgust when I look at my day on paper.
That's it?
These things?
So I avoid writing down my daily activities, even if I know what I intend to do.
I proceed jauntily as if my day were big enough to contain all its possibilities, the million different days it could be.
But I know it's only one day.
One measly little trickle mocking my thirst for experience and accomplishment.

But I suspect that this exercise, like other painful ones, offers the opportunity to grow.
Write the list and look at it.
What is so ugly about it?
Is it these particular activities?
Do you wish you weren't spending your life doing them?
The answer is one to confront.

But if these activities are good, if they are lifeworthy ones, why don't they satisfy you?
Is their ugliness your own mortality being reflected back at you?
Will you {% vbook_post make peace with it | 2023-03-22-live-in-the-moment %}?

Or does their apparent ugliness arise from the control they threaten to exert on you?
Does it make you squirm to think that you have handed over the reigns?
If you wrote this same list retrospectively at the end of the day – a catalogue of things you did, rather than things you must do – would it look more appealing?
