If writing is selection then literature is like curation.
<!--more-->
This is easy to notice about storytelling.
From an infinite stream of events and evergrowing crowds of people the writer plucks out a chosen few to construct their narrative.
Of all the action and detail available for depiction in a scene the writer selects an extreme few.
This is also true at the elemental level of words and sentences.
Good literature distills from life the beautiful and resonant that is normally diluted in the sea of mundanity in ordinary life.

Reading good books is practice in looking through this lens at your own life and noticing the beauty that hides in plain sight.
This even more so if you try writing about it as well.
You need nothing but experience of living and the words in your head.
Cast your attention out into the world like a fishing line and wait until you notice something.
A tug from subconscious.
Something stirring your curiosity.
What is it?
Is it the sunlight?
The colors, the sound of the breeze?
The oddly pleasing way the shapes arrange themselves?

Art is a means to capture these moments.
Take a picture, draw the scene, or put it in words.
Whatever you're producing is an observation not of objective reality but of [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).
From the vastness of experience you've saved a little treasure, like the jarring of a firefly, so that the magic of that moment might endure a little longer.
But you're also doing something else.
You're enjoying the act of living.
