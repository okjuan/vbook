As writing is selection, so is storytelling {% vbook_post like curation | 2024-02-04-use-restraint %}.

From an infinite stream of events and evergrowing crowds of people, the writer plucks out a chosen few to construct their narrative.
This is the case also at the elemental level of words and sentences.
Of all the action and detail available for depiction in a scene, the writer says very little.
Good literature distills from life the beautiful and the resonant normally diluted in a sea of mundanity.

Reading good books is practice in looking through this lens at your own life.
Practice in noticing the beauty that hides in plain sight.
Even more so if you try writing about it as well.
You need nothing but experience of living and the words in your head.
Cast your attention out into the world like a fishing line and wait until you notice something.
A tug from the subconscious.
Something stirring your curiosity.
What is it?
The sound of the breeze rustling in the leaves overhead?
The colors lit up in the sunlight?
The oddly pleasing way the shapes of things arrange themselves?

Art is a means for capturing these moments.
Take a picture, draw the scene, put it in words.
What you produce is an observation not of objective reality but of [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).
Like the jarring of a firefly, you've taken from the vastness a little treasure so that the magic of that moment might endure a little longer.
Something for the future, for yourself and for sharing with others.
But you're also doing something now.
You're enjoying being alive.
