Enjoying my plants.
<!--more-->

### enjoying my plants

Plant care for me is more chore than hobby, I am {% vbook_post tempted to say | 2025-06-09-use-restraint-2 %}.
But upon reflection in a better mood I notice that in the process of caring for my plants I experience many little moments of satisfaction.
One of my favorite things is noticing how the respond to my fulfilling their needs.
The day after I water them I see their perkiness restored and the firmness of their leaves replenished.
One day they sag helplessly, the next they stand proud and tall.
New offshoots bud slowly until one day they are leaves fully unfurled.
When water makes little difference, the sun does.
I move a withering plant from a dim corner to a bright area and suddenly it sports a new sheen.
