Enjoying my plants.
<!--more-->

### enjoying my plants

Plant care for me is more chore than hobby, I am {% vbook_post tempted to say | 2025-06-09-use-restraint-2 %}.
But upon reflection in a better mood I notice that in the process of caring for my plants I experience many little moments of satisfaction and even awe.
One of my favorite things is noticing how my plants respond to my fulfilling their needs.
The day after I water them I see their perkiness restored and the firmness of their leaves replenished.
One day they sag helplessly, the next their posture rights as if with pride.
New offshoots appear and bud slowly until one day they are leaves fully unfurled.
With the enthusiasm some take water, others respond to the sun.
A wellwatered but withering plant moved to a brighter area suddenly sports a new sheen.
