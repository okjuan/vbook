Journal of my trip to Japan with Z, my mom, my older sister, her boyfriend B, and my younger sister.
<!--more-->

#### Saturday 12/21/2024 / Sunday 12/22/2024 -- Tokyo

- 12:45pm direct flight from Vancouver (YVR) -> Tokyo (NRT)
- took Narita Express train to Shimbashi station and walked to the hotel stopping on the way to buy snacks at 7 Eleven
- settle in hotel, rest, and wait for the others to arrive at the hotel
- Z fell asleep so I left her and went out with my mom, sisters, and B for izakaya at a nearby restaurant
- we ate raw tuna, cheese pancakes, potato croquettes, chicken karaage, etc; B and I drank beer
- buy chocolate ice cream bar at 7 Eleven on the way back to the hotel
- collapse into sleep

Z & I flew with Air Canada.
We upgraded to Premium Economy to avoid being stuck in a couple of middle seats.
It was expensive, but it made our flight much better.
I spent the whole flight reading and writing.
I read the first 150 pages of _Normal People_ and {% vbook_post wrote about it | 2024-12-21-normal-people %}, pausing only to eat meals.
The flight was immensely productive and went by very quickly.

I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time with my family and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing copiously.
Same thing this time, in Tokyo.

#### Thursday 12/26/2024 -- Tokyo -> Takayama

- get two flat whites from INCredible Coffee
- took bullet train @ 1pm from Tokyo to Nagoya, then transferred to train to Takayama

Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train's platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn't enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying we also had to scan our IC card.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It's good we came an hour early.

#### Tuesday 12/31/2024 -- Kanazawa -> Tokyo

A thunderstorm began while were in a taxi on the way to the train station.
Flashes of lightning so bright I thought for a moment our driver had run a red light and triggered a super powerful automated stoplight camera.
We tried a coffee shop near the train station but it was closed for New Years, which is the biggest national holiday in Japan.
Train station was full of stores and flooded with white overhead lighting.
Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift playing in the overhead speakers.
We sat in Tully's Coffee lounge with our bags piled around our ankles.
On the far wall a horribly sappy and nonsensical marketing poem for _& Tea_.
I felt like I could be in any other manufactured commercial center around the world.
Soulless places like these often have this sort interchangeability, lack of identity.
Being there, it doesn't feel like you're in an actual _place_.
You're just temporarily detained in a massproduced commercial limbo.

Grateful to be back in the sun.
