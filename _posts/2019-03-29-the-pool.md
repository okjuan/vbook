I sit submerged at the bottom with my eyes closed.<br/>
<!--more-->
The drone of the pool presses on my ears,<br/>
The water muffles children yammering above.<br/>
<br/>
I’m alone on a busy summer day.<br/>
The air is bright and warm, the ground is hot.<br/>
The sky stretches blue and smooth above.<br/>
<br/>
When I resurface the day greets me with a roar.<br/>
Kids splash around me. Only my eyes move<br/>
as I stand against the edge, hair dripping.<br/>
<br/>
I’m not sure I’ll see a slow summer like this again.<br/>
I've finished playing and growing, and now<br/>
It’s time for the rest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I think about the two decades behind me,<br/>
And then the six or so ahead.<br/>
I can almost count them on one hand.<br/>
<br/>
I plunge down into the water again.<br/>
This air here a few feet below is thick and slow,<br/>
Darker, cooler, quieter.<br/>
<br/>
Little puddles round the pool lay drying in the sun<br/>
While the sea's colossal depths swallow sunlight<br/>
And warmth with appetite unyielding.<br/>
<br/>
I sit submerged, head in hands,<br/>
Vastness pushing on my eyes and ears.<br/>
With every second here, my time grows scarcer.<br/>
<br/>
This is not my world. My world is a little necklace,<br/>
A string of moments precious tiny and few<br/>
That I will bead and cherish til it’s buried with me.<br/>
<br/>
I resurface again, this time embracing the greeting.<br/>
I breathe in the warm air and push myself out onto the hot cement.<br/>
