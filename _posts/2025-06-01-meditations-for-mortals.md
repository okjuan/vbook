Those who distrust self-help books and who might snort and roll their eyes at this book merely for its subtitle -- _Four Weeks to Embrace Your Limitations and Make Time for What Counts_ -- might be surprised at the sobriety of Burkeman's advice.

In this book, Burkeman picks up where he left off in his previous book -- {% vbook_post _Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals_ | 2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks %} -- by revisting the grim fact that {% vbook_post a lifetime is a prohibitively brief window of time | 2023-03-22-live-in-the-moment %} to achieve even a fraction of the things we suppose we might do.
Burkeman's mention of mortality in the naming of his books is not an empty gesture or a manipulative marketing gambit.
His writings on the topic of time-management and day-to-day living take death out of the subtext and put it where it belongs, in the text itself.

This book offers a series of cleverly angled perspectives to transform problems purely by thinking about them differently.
Each chapter begins with a quote and Chapter Three begins with a brilliant one from Sheldon Bernard Kopp:

> You are free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences.

This is not a fantasy of omnipotence, but an energizing reminder of the control you _do_ have.
Reframing my role in this way -- from unwilling object to autonomous subject -- freed me from the futile and exhausting cycle of resent towards my circumstances and refocused my attention on what I was doing about them.
As Burkeman phrases it:
> [sometimes you'll] go ahead and do the undesirable thing because you understand the cost and you _don't_ want to incur it. Notice how different that is, how different it _feels_ from grudgingly saying yes because you feel you have no choice then resenting it for days.

In short, there are two options.
Do nothing and accept the consequences, or do what you can to get the result you want.
Idle rage makes no sense.
If the consequences are unacceptable then do something about them.
This directive triggers another liberating insight:
> [this] reminds us that most of the potential consequences we find ourselves agonizing about don't remotely justify such angst.

This also helped me enormously.
It simplified my conundrum by helping me realize that my primary task was to eliminate risk of actual harm befalling me and reducing the likelihood of costly consequences.
As long as I could fiscally, emotionally, and physically afford the potential consequences, then there was no reason to feel like I was in actual danger.
