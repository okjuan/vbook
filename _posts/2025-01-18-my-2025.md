### January

_January 18 2025_ –
Winter in the PNW has been unusually dry and sunny.
It's beautiful, and joyful if you don't stop to think about the disastrous climactic changes it might portend.

_April 1 2025_ –
Over the last few days I've been rereading all my [/now]({{site.baseurl}}/now) updates starting from the {% vbook_post first one | 2023-11-21-now %} in November '23.
I've been journaling in various forms for years now and still I am surprised by its usefulness.
It's so easy to forget our moods and modes, our thoughts and experiences.
I maintain that journaling is a way to live longer.
Through it and through intangible other forms of reflection I am determined to defeat the notions that time flies, that life is short.

Looking back at what I appended to {% vbook_post _what I'm doing now #7_ | 2025-01-11-now %} on January 14th, a mere two and a half months ago, I am taken aback by what I wrote:

> I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.

I'd forgotten this.
This is one of the joys of writing.
Most things I write I leave for a couple weeks while I occupy myself with new ideas only to come back to the old ones and find myself yet again intrigued and surprised by what this person who I supposedly am had to say.

### February

_January 18 2025_ –
In early February we have a couple plans for gatherings with friends.
We also intend to visit Victoria.
I look forward to it.
I'm realizing I have a positive association with February.
Perhaps because it's the month when we usually get snow in the PNW and for a couple days our surroundings are awash in white and sunshine.

_February 4 2025_ –
As foretold the annual snowdump came down in February, this time on the very first evening of the month.
For people like me that rely on outdoor sports like soccer and biking for exercise it's rather inconvenient but that inconvenience is more than repaid in stunning views of snowcovered mountains looming above the clouds, lit in the early sunset.
Not to mention the ease with which one could drive up one of those mountains for a weekday evening of skiing.
Diligently the neighborhood character that in the spring and summer tends to the garden in the nearby rotunda today scrapes off the snow from a sidewalk path and peppers blue salt into the gash of concrete as if to cauterize it.
I greet him and he responds with a grin _Living the dream!_
On the roads his mechanized counterpart heaves aside large mounds of snow effortlessly with its front and from its back showers its trail with salt.
I walk ten minutes to one of the sushi restaurants in the area to pick up my lunch.
Too hungry to wait until I get home I pause and stand beneath the awning outside the restaurant and drink my miso soup and watch the neighborhood go on without me on its natural rhythm.

_June 24 2025_ –
The decision Z and I made in February to upgrade apartments in Vancouver was a brilliant one.
It came about because Z and I regularly wished we had a second bedroom so that we could both comfortably work from home.
Every few months, I scanned Facebook Marketplace for rentals and we even visited a few places, but we never found anything good.
Then, one night, after watching a YouTube video about the slight rent decline in Canadian cities, I scanned again.
This time, I found one option that actually looked good.
Within a week, we'd signed the lease.
It all happened very quickly.
As time has passed, however, I have only felt more confidence in our decision.

### March

_February 4 2025_ –
I have loose plans to watch _Mickey 17_ with friends when it comes out in theaters.
It was written and directed by Bong Joon-Ho, who directed and cowrote the magnificent [_Parasite_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)).

### April

_April 25 2025_ –
This spring has been a turbulent time for me.
For several weeks issues of immigration and taxes have plagued my thoughts mercilessly.
They are the kind of problems I wish I could banish from my life forever.
They are meaningless problems that threaten retaliation not by a person but by an amorphous, impersonal entity of brute force and unreckonable reach.
The task is not so much facing reality but placating a selfappointed arbiter of it.
To avoid these problems is to risk persecution from the world itself.

Unlike interpersonal problems, these allow little opportunity for persuasion or compromise or compassion, unless a not-fully-dehumanized bureaucrat sneaks some in between the paperwork.
The main recourse is just that – paperwork.
For people in my situation that means hiring my own (expensive) functionaries to prepare papers that will please the faraway and faceless adversarial functionaries so that they in turn dissuade their armed counterparts from deploying violence on me.
But fear not!
For our underdog has been schooled in the art of reading instructions carefully and filling out answers dutifully even for questions absurd or irrelevant.
He knows how to deal in this horrible cypher of ink and paper to earn whatever prized document he needs to secure passage between manufactured realities and to live a life unhounded inside them.
Let's not dwell on those not so well prepared or those of lesser means.

### May

_February 4 2025_ –
May is the month the European soccer season climaxes.
League and cup winners alike are crowned.
Arsenal, the team I support, are still in the running for two major honors: the English Premier League (EPL) and the UEFA Champions League.
Two days ago they defeated the reigning EPL champions by a whopping and unforeseeable 5-1 scoreline.
And yet our biggest competitor this season is not them, but Liverpool, who are six points ahead of us with a game in hand.
In early May, Arsenal will go to northern England and duel them at Anfield, Liverpool's fortress.
_That_ will probably be Arsenal's biggest match of the season.
I start to feel a bit queasy thinking about it now, three months ahead.
It's shocking how thrilling it is even from a thousands of miles away to support a sports team embroiled in genuine competition.

### June

_June 24 2025_ –
I had a moment last week when I realized I was finally out of the woods.
There are no longer any tax and immigration issues for me to address.
The tallest wave has come and gone and I've not drowned.
It sounds melodramatic but I was in physical pain for much of the spring.
The patch of excema that flared on my left hand appears on the way to recovery.
I can breathe a ragged sigh of relief.
I feel free to let my mind loose again.

Now, my most pressing concerns are meaningful ones.
Z and I have a London trip to plan.
And before that, perhaps also a small anniversary weekend away together.
And when July arrives, my day-to-day job will be to enjoy the two whole months of uninterrupted sunny weather we get in the PNW.

There's also the question of where we will live next year.
(As I write this, it occurs to me that this experiment of {% vbook_post "live journaling" | 2025-01-18-writing-my-2025 %} could expand its scope beyond the current year.
I suppose that piece would be called _what I'm doing in my life_ and it could be dense with references to other pieces, including the [_what I'm doing now_]({{site.baseurl}}/now) pieces.)
It could be Seattle or New York if Z gets her long awaited green card, or it could be somewhere in Europe – the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany.
We'll see.

### July

_April 1 2025_ –
Spring is springing and I'm already looking forward to the paddleboard season in the summer.
Many of our friends in Seattle own paddleboards and we all go out on the lake regularly in July and August.
I expect this summer we will spend many more hours out on the water.
I'm also looking forward to Sports Days – afternoons we spend in the park playing volleyball and soccer, listening to music, snacking, and drinking cold beverages.
And a new tradition I anticipate will involve lots of leisurely communal outdoor time in the backyard of the house that my friend owns and a bunch of us live in.
It's going to be great.

### August

_April 1 2025_ –
Some friends and I are thinking of taking a trip to the San Juan Islands or to some other natural destination in the region.
If indeed we do so in August it may coincide with some of our birthdays.

### September

_April 1 2025_ –
Paul Thomas Anderson's new movie comes out in September.
He is one of my favorite directors and film writers.
I really enjoyed _Licorice Pizza_ in theatres and _There Will Be Blood_ is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I have multiple friends who would also be excited to see his newest work in theatres.

### October

### November

### December

_February 4 2025_ –
In the spirit of living with forethought and premeditation, I suggested to my mom that we begin planning a post-Christmas trip to Mexico or Guatemala, somewhere warm.
In years past I've intended to buy flights for the holiday season months in advance but never managed it.
Hopefully this year.

_April 1 2025_ –
Z began learning to snowboard this season and has been slowing buying her own gear.
The current season is winding down now but I look forward to the next one.
