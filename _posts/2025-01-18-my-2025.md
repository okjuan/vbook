This live journal is yet another of my experiments inspired by the ideas I originally explored in my essay [_The Virtual Book_](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360).
<!--more-->
One of the attributes of "{% vbook_post virtual books | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %}" that most intrigues me is their **dynamism**, the fact that they can change over time.
It excites me not because of its practicality, but because of the artistic possibilities it creates.
As I wrote originally in _The Virtual Book_ and then reproduced in {% vbook_post one | 2022-06-11-show-instead-of-telling %} of its separated pieces on this site:

> What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
> Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
> What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
> What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?

In this journal I intend to do something like the hypothetical memoirist.
Throughout the year, whenever I feel so inclined, I will write here about events that might happen, are happening, or have happened in 2025.
I think it will be interesting to juxtapose my expectations, experiences, and reflections throughout the year.
I hope it will neutralize the bias we typically grant hindsight, which is a privileged perspective but not a consummate one.

### January

_January 18 2024_ -
Winter in the PNW has been unusually dry and sunny.
It's beautiful, and joyful if you don't stop to think about the disastrous climactic changes it might portend.

### February

_January 18 2024_ -
In early February we have a couple plans for gatherings with friends.
We also intend to visit Victoria.
I look forward to it.
I'm realizing I have a positive association with February.
Perhaps because it's the month when we usually get snow in the PNW and for a couple days our surroundings are awash in white and sunshine.
