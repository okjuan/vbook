While I write this, from where I am sitting on my balcony I can see the TV out of the corner of my eye and it's very difficult to ignore it.

I keep turning my head away to think of what to write next, but then when I turn back to resume typing on my computer, the flashes of color and light from the TV make it very difficult for me to focus.
I just went inside and turned it off, but still my mind keeps diverting attention to the now black rectangle in my peripheral vision.
Let me draw the curtains.

Sometimes when I want to be alone I come out and sit here.
It's a lovely little space detached from the living room.
However, if Z is sitting at her desk on the other side of the glass where I can see her and if my need to be alone in that moment is particularly potent, I draw the curtains.
Nothing changes except what is in my field of perception.
Her presence remains exactly as it was, but I don't experience it the same way.

In his book {% vbook_post _The World Beyond Your Head_ | 2024-12-07-world-beyond-your-head %}, Matthew B. Crawford points out that this involuntary aspect of attention makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary standpoint.
New information demands attendance.
Is it a predator?
Prey?
Or just a gust of wind?
Regardless we must pay attention to it so we can make sense of it and integrate it into our live mental model of our current environment.

Crawford appropriates the term _ecology_ -- the branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings -- to describe this fundamental relationship between our attention, our life, and our environment.
He describes the "ecology of attention" in airport lounges that endlessly stream the news on TVs oriented in various directions.
The talking heads may be muted but the infinite sideways scroll of symbols will likely command the attention of even the most bookish traveler whose gaze cannot avoid it.

(Crawford astutely points out that the advertisements shown on these TVs exist to continue the transfer of wealth from these common travelers to the ones in the VIP lounges, who rest comfortably without having their attention exploited by their surroundings without their consent.
I find these socioeconomic analyses of technology much more relevant and important than the technophobic ones.
The same goes for Artificial Intelligence.
I don't worry that AI will take over the world, I worry about how AI will be a nefarious tool in the hands of those that already rule the world.)

I think the evoluntionary perspective can also help explain why time in nature feels so right.
This is the primordial ecology of our attention, the environment in which our brains adapted for us to live and thrive.
And yet I don't think we need to draw purist or atavistic conclusions against technology from this observation.
Feelings of connection and coherence arise in us not only from time in nature, but also from time using artificial tools and inhabiting constructed environments.

The humble coffee shop for example is a place where many of us come to work and connect spontaneously with a community.
It offers a homeostasis of music, chatter, noise, silence, movement, rest, public and personal conversation, ebb and flow of activity.
Certain kinds of technologies are essential here and even computer screens are welcome, but not TVs because they would disrupt the ecology of attention.
