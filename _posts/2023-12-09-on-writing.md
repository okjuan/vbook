Half memoir, half advice for aspiring fiction writers.
Both good.

I enjoy and mostly trust his [writing advice]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-12-09-king-writing-advice %}).

### for god's sake, make it virtual!

This is yet [another]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2021-08-06-possibilities %}) book that should be made [virtual]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2023-08-11-virtual-book %}).

It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King's life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King's near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don't buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that's how he usually writes!

I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don't go terribly together.
But they'd go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.

The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece -- the one that _is_ actually King's thoughts "on writing" -- and King's fans could hear about their beloved author's background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.

Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King's thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King's book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.
