Thoughtful and witty, infusing some ideas about the philosophy of knowledge into real, human struggles and situations.

Downside is that the book's main message wasn't delivered coherently.
Even in the intro and conclusion, the author covers a variety of ideas related to rationality, persuasion, and knowledge, but sums them up only awkwardly into a vague thesis.

However, the thesis is important and would benefit from more development, I think: We must give more consideration to the dynamics of relationships between people and within single individuals to better understand how beliefs are formed and altered.
Concepts such as trust, complacency, obedience, coercion, and selfhood play central roles in how people make important decisions about their personal life.
