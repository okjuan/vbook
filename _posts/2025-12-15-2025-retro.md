  - description: I fell in love with Vancouver.
    entries:
      - commentary: "It offers much of what Seattle gives – mild winters & gorgeous summers, lively urban life & proximity to nature, great breweries & coffee shops – and it's safer, prettier, more bikeable, and less car-centric. I love Capitol Hill but I love The Drive even more. And yet there's something Seattle has over Vancouver: higher pay."
  - description: I got back into golf, a game I learned and loved to play in childhood.
    entries:
      - commentary: "I went to a nearby Pitch & Putt a few times alone and a couple times with friends before it occurred to me to invite my wife Z. I suppose because one time when I played alone ahead of me were a married couple. Z had never played but gone with her mom to the range a few times. She took to it like a duck to water. We've discovered another activity we like to do together."
  - description: I predetermined most of the books I read.
    entries:
      - commentary: "This was the first time I made a reading plan for the year. Ironically, I put little thought into it. Most the list I chose arbitrarily from the dozens of books I own but have not read. I made a list not because I wanted to focus on particular themes, styles, or topics but because I wanted to challenge myself to stick to a plan and to read copiously. What I discovered is that my reading throughput increases if I allow certain kinds of books into the mix. In the spring there was a period when I read more because I was reading two books in parallel, _Pachinko_ and _Blood Meridian_. Emotionally neither book is light but in _Pachinko_ the writing is simple and grounded and the story is straightforward and fastmoving. When I had time to read but picking up _Blood Meridian_ felt like a task, it was easy to fan open _Pachinko_ instead. In the afternoons and early evenings when the weather was nice enough I went out into the neighborhood with both books in my bag and by the time I found a seat I knew which one better suited my appetite."
  - description: I started taking baths.
    entries:
      - commentary: "In late May I had a slew of friends over to watch the Champions League final. As I like to do when friends see my home for the first time I gave the newcomers a quick tour. At one point I mentioned that I never used the clawfoot bathtub and one of my friends remarked that I didn't know what I was missing. So I tried it and now I know what I'm not missing. It's a great option when I come home tired and sweaty from a soccer game. I don't have to wait until after I shower to rest, I can do it _while_ I bathe. I lounge in there for a while, drinking a cold beverage and watching YouTube on my laptop. On weekends sometimes I'll read in the bath by the light of the window."
  - description: I learned that certain movie theatres project actual film.
    entries:
      - commentary: "And as soon as I began enjoying it I almost lost it. A couple months ago, Cineplex announced that The Park Theatre in Vancouver – the only cinema for hundreds of kilometers in any direction that projects 120mm film – would be closed permanently. Public outcry culminated in the theatre's rescue by the likes of Sean Baker and other notable names in contemporary film and TV, one of Vancouver's major industries. (Most recently I discovered Cinematheque in downtown Vancouver, a nonprofit theatre that shows international and independent films.) I'm heartened that management at the Rio Theatre, another beloved local venue, will be taking over operation of The Park. It remains to be seen whether the 120mm film projector will survive the transition."
  - description: I suffered the stress of tax complications.
    entries:
      - commentary: "It felt like the fear and uncertainty racking my brain and body would never abate but finally they have. As the year closes I feel, finally, that I understand my situation and that it is stable. I am so relieved. This year this topic took up residence in the back of mind and from there tortured me for many weeks. I can't wait for it recede into memory."
  - description: I stood up on a surfboard for the first time.
    entries:
      - commentary: "For a second year in a row we spent a few days in Tofino, BC to celebrate my mom's birthday. It's a beautiful and strange place – a remote seaside colony where avid surfers come from the Commonwealth at large labor for the leisures of wealthy soujourners in exchange for an idyllic stint on the raw edge of the Pacific. They work as baristas, servers, cooks, surf instructors, and they're all remarkably happy. No doubt for most this is a temporary situation. I imagine they live in blissful awareness of a fleeting golden period, a time of very little responsibility and immense immediate freedom. Whatever serious pursuit they may have abandoned or postponed to come here can wait because they have time on their side and joy today."
  - description: I learned how [Vancouver plans](https://www.shapeyourcity.ca/vancouver-plan) to develop in the next 25 years.

      - commentary: ""
  - description: I witnessed the bureaucratic process by which cities are shaped and governed.
    entries:
      - commentary: "In navigating the modern world an ordinary citizen finds success in great proportion to their ability to navigate bureaucracies. Access is granted by fares paid in the currency of paperwork – exams, resumes, applications, appeals, tickets. It sounds silly and trivial until you see reality itself change shape in one way and neglect to do so in another way in attempts to adhere to bureacracatic decree. Watching meetings of the Vancouver City Council has opened my eyes to the immense power at play in city politics. Boring and dry as the meetings may be, they shape our material reality. Normally, meetings and bureaucratic processes stultify me, but in this case I feel greater agency. I see an intelligible process of consequence with points of access for influence."
