  - description: I fell in love with Vancouver.
    entries:
      - commentary: "It offers much of what Seattle gives – mild winters & gorgeous summers, lively urban life & proximity to nature, great breweries & coffee shops – and it's safer, prettier, more bikeable, and less car-centric. I love Capitol Hill but I love The Drive even more. And yet there's something Seattle has over Vancouver: higher pay."
  - description: I got back into golf, a game I learned and loved to play in childhood.
    entries:
      - commentary: "I went to a nearby Pitch & Putt a few times alone and a couple times with friends before it occurred to me to invite my wife Z. I suppose because one time when I played alone ahead of me were a married couple. Z had never played but gone with her mom to the range a few times. She took to it like a duck to water. We've discovered another activity we like to do together."
  - description: I predetermined most of the books I read.
    entries:
      - commentary: "This was the first time I made a reading plan for the year. Ironically, I put little thought into it. Most the list I chose arbitrarily from the dozens of books I own but have not read. I made a list not because I wanted to focus on particular themes, styles, or topics but because I wanted to challenge myself to stick to a plan and to read copiously. What I discovered is that my reading throughput increases if I allow certain kinds of books into the mix. In the spring there was a period when I read more because I was reading two books in parallel, _Pachinko_ and _Blood Meridian_. Emotionally neither book is light but in _Pachinko_ the writing is simple and grounded and the story is straightforward and fastmoving. When I had time to read but picking up _Blood Meridian_ felt like a task, it was easy to fan open _Pachinko_ instead. In the afternoons and early evenings when the weather was nice enough I went out into the neighborhood with both books in my bag and by the time I found a seat I knew which one better suited my appetite."
