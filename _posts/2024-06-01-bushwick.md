One of the goals of our trip to NYC was to test our interest in moving there in the next couple of years.

It's easy to fantasize about moving to the big city, but would we actually like living there?
Where, in particular, could we see ourselves?

For the first three nights, Z and I stayed in an Airbnb in the southern corner of Bushwick, between Broadway and Bushwick Ave.
It was obvious immediately that the area would be far too noisy for our dog, Baxter, who is generally terrified of city noise and would be reduced to a trembling lump by the thunder and shriek of the subway and ongoing maintenance work on its elevated railway along Broadway.

The location was great for our trip, though.
Within walking distance we had plenty of bars, coffee shops, restaurants, convenience stores, and even a small comedy club.
It as easy to have an eventful first night despite having arrived at the Airbnb at 9pm, tired after a long day of travel from Seattle via Detroit and a long Lyft ride from Newark.
Also with walking distance were subway stations for the J, L, A, & C lines, which made it easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan.

Bushwick, according to my friend that lives there, is the hip, artsy neighborhood that Williamsburg was ten years ago, before it fell into the sterilizing grasp of corporations.
Bushwick's ongoing gentrification is palpable on a walk east to west through the heart of the neighborhood.
On Saturday afternoon we came out of Myrtle-Wyckoff station onto Myrtle Ave's small pedestrian strip crowded with carts and market stalls selling a variety of Latin American street food to local Latino families.
We'd left the noise of the L underground, but above ground cars honked, music blasted, people called and chattered, and the M ran overhead.

As we walked west on Knickerbocker Ave towards Maria Hernandez Park, we started noticing trendy-looking delis among the Mexican and Central American restaurants, and the unmistakable presence of white, tote-carrying young folks.
The contrast culminates near the west end of Knickerbocker in a cluster where genuine bohemian and upstart enterprise comingles with a creeping corporate presence.
There is SEY Coffee, an exceptional third wave coffee shop that considers gratuity in its prices, and Roberta's, a charmingly hip and casual Italian restaurant that serves fantastic pizza and drinks in a grungey, dungeonous atmosphere.
And there are good vintage clothing stores, like the sprawling [Urban Jungle](https://www.ltrainvintagenyc.com/new-page-3) and the small, curated [28 Scott Vintage](https://28scott.com), which offers complementary mini chocolate bars and self-serve liquor in tiny solo cups arranged in brass dishware.
In the same area, however, there is the trendy-kitschy shop [Friends NYC](https://friendsnyc.com/) charging outrageous prices for cheaply made trinkets and a surprisingly corporate-feeling [Shops at the Loom](http://theloomnyc.com/main.html), which advertises their building so:

> "The Loom" offers a wide array of spaces for the serious artist or entrepreneur. This renovation boasts the finest in commercial work space in Brooklyn! All spaces feature brand new or refinished hard wood floors, classic tin ceilings, brand-new windows, new heating systems, kitchenettes, and washroom facilities..."The Loom" is truly inspirational and is sure to be a great choice for you and your art or business.

Unserious artists will have to get by with unclassic, tin-free ceilings until they scrounge up some serious dough.
Having managed that, they can click through the DIY facade of ["The Loom"](http://www.theloomnyc.com/main.html) and over to [bushburg.com](https://www.bushburg.com/) to submit their application.
