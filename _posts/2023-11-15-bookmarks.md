This page is inspired by Viktor Lofgren's [The Small Website Discoverability Crisis](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/) and Tom Critchlow's [list of digital bookshelves](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/books/bookshelves/).
<!--more-->
It's a reference list of websites that I have visited in the past and may want to visit again.

There are a handful of sites that I frequent these days.
Normally I start by going to [sive.rs/now](https://sive.rs/now) to see what Derek Sivers has been up to recently.
Reading it inspires and mobilizes me.
I also tend to check [macwright.com/reading](https://macwright.com/reading/) to see what Tom MacWright has been reading.
I recently picked up {% vbook_post _The World Beyond Your Head_ | 2024-12-07-world-beyond-your-head %} because he gave it five stars and it wouldn't be hyperbole to say it has changed my life.
Not majorly, but in a smaller, meaningful way.
As I wrote at the end of _my_ most recent {% vbook_post /now | 2025-01-11-now %} update, I begin 2025 with strong intentions regarding what I do with my attention.

In his January 16, 2025 /now update, Derek Sivers linked to [this essay](https://craigmod.com/essays/electric_bikes/) about the joy of riding an electric bike.
I spent the next couple hours learning about this guy, [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com).
I'm thrilled to find another person who is and has been thinking deeply about books as technology and creating {% vbook_post booklike | 2024-11-29-what-3 %} (he calls "book-shaped") experiences online.
Craig is not the first technologist-writer whose site I've encountered recently.
I also found [robinsloan.com](https://www.robinsloan.com/) and [jsomers.net](https://jsomers.net/), both of whom are accomplished writers and experienced programmers.

Although personal sites are perhaps the most exciting, there are also some great ones run by organizations.
The most special of these is probably [Capitol Hill Seattle Blog](https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/), a neighborhood blog turned crowdsourced news site turned indepedent and ultralocal news site.
It's special not only because it is independent but because it offers volumes of dense and specific information about a focused locale.
I'm yet to find anything else like it.

I also used to be a big fan of [pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool), but lately have lost some of my enthusiasm for them because they seem to pick topics for novelty and appeal.
They are perhaps more an entertainment company than a journalism firm.

I often come across new sites and I like to save them here to remind myself to check back on them and consider adding them to the small set of sites I frequent.
Here are sites that haven't made it into my special list but I want to revisit soon:
