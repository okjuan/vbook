I picked up this book to learn about Norman Mailer's writing style.
He really is a very good chronicler.
<!--more-->
His writing is very clear, human, warm, and vivid.
Shades of John Steinbeck.
He does a great job of {% vbook_post writing from various perspectives | 2023-06-30-narrate-transparently %} and of building from real life events a plot that feels inevitable.
Foreshadowing exists in literature because it exists in life.
There are hints and omens, but life is busy and complicated and ever-moving.
Mistakes are decisions that the future spoils.
This book conveys both of these things very well: the inevitability and the ambiguity of what will come.
