Here is Paul Harding in _Tinkers_ relating a boy's attempt to run away from home.

> The sunny weekend morning, the lackadaisical mule, and the extra heaviness of the slow rate imparted by the bulk of the wagon conspired to dilute [the boy]'s half notions of speed and flight and pursuit and evasion.

Easy to notice is {% vbook_post Harding's excess | 2026-01-30-restraint %} in phrases like _the extra heaviness of the slow rate imparted by the bulk of the wagon_ and _speed and flight and pursuit and evasion_.
Do we really need all these words?
But the sentence has a more fundamental issue.
Why personify the circumstances into "conspiring" agents?
It's a creative formulation, but does it contribute anything to what is being expressed?

The point of inventive wording, I think, is to illuminate the subject by casting particular light on it.
Phrasing should be effective, not affected.
Why did Harding choose this phrasing?
A humbler one would eschew wordy choices like _conspire_ and _impart_ to allow apt words like _dilute_, _deflate_, or _dissipate_ to play the central role in the idea being conveyed.
Something like:

> The boy’s notions of flight and pursuit dissipated as he sat on this bulky wagon towed by this lackadaisical mule on this sunny weekend morning.

Already, the sentence is more faithful to its meaning.
We've halved _speed and flight and pursuit and evasion_ into _flight and pursuit_ and reconfigured the sentence to make its verb, _dissipated_, relevant to the sentence's principal message: reality is deflating the boy's fantasy of running away.
We no longer state that the boy's fantasy is slipping away because of his circumstances, but we imply it.

The second half of our new sentence is a bit monotonous.
Further iteration can help:

> The boy’s notions of flight and pursuit dissipated as the wagon trundled along in the sunny weekend morning.

We've removed explicit mention of the _lackadaisical mule_ and the _bulky_ nature of the wagon in favor of a useful verb: _trundled_.
However, we have somewhat weakened the implication that the slowness of the escape vehicle and the pleasant weather are to blame for the boy's change in mood.
We can also try another structure:

> As the wagon trundled along through the sunny weekend morning, the boy's notions of flight and pursuit dissipated.

Not only does this sentence strengthen the implication of the causual relationship between the environment and the boy's psychology, it also heightens the sense of passing time in which the boy's fantasies gradually lose their believability.

But this effect ends abruptly because the sentence ends immediately after the word _dissipated_.
We can draw out the sense further by making space at the end of the sentence into which the dissipation can extend in the way its meaning suggests:

> As the wagon trundled along, the boy's notions of flight and pursuit dissipated into the sunny weekend morning.

At this point, we have space for the _lackadaisical mule_:

> As the mule shuffled along and the wagon trundled behind it, the boy's notions of flight and pursuit dissipated into the sunny weekend morning.

_Lackadaisical_ is a fun word indeed, but _As the wagon trundled along behind the lackadaisical mule_ dissatisfies me.
I prefer _the mule shuffled_, I think it creates a more vivid image in the mind.
There's good reason for the rule of thumb Verbs over Adjectives.
They help to {% vbook_post make instead of describing | 2021-01-10-make.instead.of.describing %}.
Fancy words and fancy phrasings tend to contribute less than they provide.
Their sacrifice allows the spotlight to fall on the content instead of falling on the writer, and ultimately, in a quieter way, this reflects well on the writer.
