Here is Paul Harding in _Tinkers_ relating a boy's attempt to run away from home.

> The sunny weekend morning, the lackadaisical mule, and the extra heaviness of the slow rate imparted by the bulk of the wagon conspired to dilute [the boy]'s half notions of speed and flight and pursuit and evasion.

Easy to notice is {% vbook_post Harding's excess | 2026-01-30-restraint %} in phrases like _the extra heaviness of the slow rate imparted by the bulk of the wagon_ and _speed and flight and pursuit and evasion_.
Do we really need all these words?
But the sentence has a more fundamental issue.
Why personify the circumstances into "conspiring" agents?
It's a creative formulation, but does it contribute anything to what is being expressed?

The point of inventive wording, I think, is to express something about the subject by illuminating or highlighting it in some way.
Phrasing should be effective, not affected.
Why did Harding choose this phrasing instead of a humbler one that eschews wordy choices like _conspire_ and _impart_ to make space for relevant words like _dilute_, _deflate_, or _dissipate_ to play the central role in the idea being conveyed?
Something like:

> The boy’s notions of flight and pursuit dissipated as he sat on this bulky wagon towed by this lackadaisical mule on this sunny weekend morning.

Already, the sentence is truer to its meaning.
We could iterate on it to improve its second half:

> The boy’s notions of flight and pursuit dissipated as the wagon trundled along on the sunny weekend morning.

And try other structures:

> As the wagon trundled along through the sunny weekend morning, the boy's notions of flight and pursuit dissipated.

And tweak it:

> As the wagon trundled along, the boy's notions of flight and pursuit dissipated into the sunny weekend morning.

These phrasings sacrifice the stylishness of the original so that the spotlight can fall on the content instead of falling on the writer.
