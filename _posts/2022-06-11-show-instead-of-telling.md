A modern torchbearer of {% post_url_with_hover_card Thompson’s immersion journalism | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story %} is comedian-journalist [Andrew Callaghan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg).
<!--more-->
He roams America in his RV interviewing the country’s kookiest characters and recording their antics.
Like Thompson, Callaghan throws himself into the action.
With false innocence, he encourages his subjects to rant and reveal their quirks and delusions.
In [Return to Tallega](https://youtu.be/6tuYIXi6nTQ), Callaghan shows the unhinged debauchery of beer-soaked racing festivals of the American South much like Thompson did with [The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentucky_Derby_Is_Decadent_and_Depraved).
Tom Wolfe compared the techniques of literary realism {% post_url_with_hover_card to electricity | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story %} in the otherwise mechanical machine of journalism; he might’ve enjoyed seeing Callaghan modernize the practice with literal electricity.

Ironically, the old writing principle _show don’t tell_ can lead us {% post_url_with_hover_card beyond words | 2022-06-11-tell-a-story-2 %} as it has [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/): a digital publication specializing in ‘visual essays’ developed by ‘Journalist-Engineers’ that write both prose and source code to create their articles.
Their piece [_How Music Taste Evolved_](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/), more app than article, lets the user click through pop music history to hear snippets of songs that topped the charts from 1958 until 2016.
Instead of forcing you to read about the contrast between the swaying, dreamy sound of [Smoke Gets In Your Eyes](https://youtu.be/57tK6aQS_H0) and the youthful pep of [Stagger Lee](https://youtu.be/FCPutYaGFlE), it lets you hear it.
And if you’re not interested in pop music from early 1959, then you can leap forward to whatever decade interests you.
The involvement of the reader is literal.

As refreshing as it is, the piece is far from fulfilling its potential.
The first improvement is obvious: automatically update every day with the newest song at the top the charts.
(The equivalent for printed books, publishing new editions, is pathetic in comparison.) The piece could take its interactivity to the next level by letting you save songs to your music library or dive into specific artists by linking to their Wikipedia articles, which also update with new information and themselves lead to other articles.
Or it could browse the internet on your behalf to find live performances and interesting articles, showing new things every time you visit.

Using technology, we can bring information alive and make our interactions with it more meaningful.
As Michael Scott puts it:

> You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity…you put your hand on a metal ball and your hair sticks up straight.
> And you know science.

The benefit of combining mediums is clearest in education, where you want to build both analytical and intuitive understanding.
A musician trying to teach music theory should think twice about writing a traditional book.
Alongside their theoretical explanations, they could offer an interface that lets the user add notes to a music staff and hear what they sound like; or listens to the user play their instrument and transcribes it in real time.
A writer passionate about Hemingway’s writing principles and bent on teaching them may feel the urge to write a book; and, although it would educate aspiring writers, it would lack the interactive experience offered by [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/), which shows a writer in real time what rules they are breaching.
(To what extent the rules can be codified is a [different question](https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/).)

As one of the architects responsible for the daring design of the Seattle Central Library [said](https://youtu.be/1x0PA0Rnjho):

> Books are technology; that’s something people forget.
> But it’s a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.

What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?

Long before the birth of the digital world, writers like Hunter S. Thompson breached conventional forms to create new experiences for readers.
And writers can continue to experiment within the book-bound format without intervention from outer disciplines.
But they could also work with designers and engineers to create literature’s equivalent to musical technology like synthesizers and drum machines — the tools that Herbie Hancock used to {% post_url_with_hover_card reinvent his art | 2022-06-11-reinvent-yourself %} time and time again.
If we give artists creative technology, we’ll get back experiences we didn’t even know we were missing.
