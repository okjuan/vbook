Here's an example of coordinated metaphors, something I wish {% post_url_with_hover_card other writers | 2023-03-09-coordinate-metaphors %} used more often.
<!--more-->
It's an excerpt from {% post_url_with_hover_card how to work #2 | 2023-01-22-work-2 %}, my essay about choosing your next activity based on your current energy level:
> Adapting to the ebb and flow of your capacity makes you not only more efficient, but happier. **Your efforts bear more fruit because you know when the moment is ripe, and you learn to savor small victories when nothing bigger is within reach.**

In the second sentence, I try to create a single, fluid image in the reader's mind by coordinating the metaphors **bear more fruit**, **moment is ripe**, **savor small victories**, and **within reach**.

But, to be fair, I am biased.
I wonder how many other readers enjoy it like I do, and whether any feel tension between the other images in the excerpt.
Does **ebb and flow** in the first sentence clash with the fruit imagery in the second sentence?
To coordinate the metaphors across the two sentences, I could replace **ebb and flow** with something about seasons, for example.
But that might shift the reader's attention too far from _what_ is said to _how_ it's said.
The second sentence alone risks this by including _too many_ coordinated metaphors, but stays in bounds by not forcing or contriving them.

The goal is not to say to the reader, _hey, you see how clever I am?_ but instead to put satisfying images in their head, preferably without them thinking too much about how they got there.

I think **ebb and flow**, as another image from nature, complements the fruit imagery.
This works especially because the third sentence in the paragraph also contains natural images:

> Adapting to the ebb and flow of your capacity makes you not only more efficient, but happier. Your efforts bear more fruit because you know when the moment is ripe, and you learn to savor small victories when nothing bigger is within reach. **Gone is the guilt of “being lazy” when your energy dips because you know it’s just a phase in a cycle, a valley in a range of peaks.**

These images coordinate not only between themselves but also with a key idea of the essay: there is peace in respecting and abiding by rules of nature.

But, again, I may be at odds with potential readers of {% post_url_with_hover_card how to work #2 | 2023-01-22-work-2 %}.
I suppose the feeling comes also from the literal images of nature I included in the original version I posted [on Medium](https://okjuan.medium.com/is-this-working-2-4343dc4594eb).
