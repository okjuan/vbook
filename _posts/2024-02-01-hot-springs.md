It was the coldest weekend of winter so naturally we went swimming.
Outdoors.
<!--more-->
Hunched against the cold in our hotel bathrobes we crunched over the snow between pools in our slippers, looking for the hottest one.
Of course, it turned out to be the one everyone was crowded into.
For a few hours we crouched in the hot water avoiding eye contact with the multitude around us -- a family reunion, couples on anniversary weekend getaways -- trying to convince Z's mom and stepdad that renting was a [better option than buying](https://macwright.com/2023/12/21/homeownership) in their current circumstances.

Despite the weather, our timing could've been worse.
The night before, a pipe had burst and caused chaos.
The hotel had to turn away guests with reservations because the heating wasn't working in a portion of the building.
Things were back under control when we checked in the day after.

In the evening Z and I went for drinks and dessert at the hotel's lounge, The Copper Room.
Like the other couples, we sat at one of the white cloth-draped tables surrounding the dance floor.
The waiter cocked his head and cracked jokes, serving us cheerily and gliding from table to table.
The band started playing another oldie and a couple in their thirties came out onto the dance floor.
They danced clumnsily near the edge of the big hardwood rectangle, far from the stage, near our section of tables.
The man smiled blankly as he led his partner awkwardly and she grinned in embarrassment, head bowed as she went through the motions half-heartedly.
I suppose we shouldn't have been surprised when she took a tumble, such was the lack of coordination between all components -- music, limbs, lovers.
They scuttled off the dance floor only to reappear a couple songs later to join the other couples that had crept onto the floor.
