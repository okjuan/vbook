Awesome read about an accomplished writer's career and life.

This book piqued my interest in magazines -- I wonder if current ones are as interesting as New York magazine sounds like it was in the 60s and 70s.

My main complaint is that Sheehy could have delved more deeply into her emotions and those of her loved ones.
This book doesn't rival the intimacy of Patti Smith's __Just Kids__.
But then again it would be hard to, since this book describes a whole life and Just Kids focuses on a certain chunk of Smith's life.
