There are many different ways to sum up a year.
Here are some.

### through music

In 2024, for the seventh year in a row, I kept a journal playlist, to which I added throughout the year songs that I listened to repeatedly.

### through journaling

I posted four entries in 2024:
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #3 | 2024-02-19-now %}, posted on February 19th
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #4 | 2024-04-23-now %}, posted on April 23rd
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #5 | 2024-07-07-now %}, posted on July 7th
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #6 | 2024-09-30-now %}, posted on September 30th

I tried to post more often but it was difficult to do so considering the level of detail I put in each one.
