Alfred Adler claimed that all problems were interpersonal relationship problems.

Freudian psychoanalysts credit childhood trauma and unconscious drives as fundamental.
Lately I've been thinking about ego and self-image as a gravitational center that grounds our thoughts and behavior.
(Ego is an overloaded term and I've written about {% vbook_post my sense | 2023-11-21-ego %} of it.)

I think that the ongoing [male crisis](https://youtu.be/GHkhTIEe254?si=qWMV2Zo8Z6qIQqet) can be articulated in terms of ego and self-esteem.
I suspect the rage many men feel is {% vbook_post self-loathing reflected outward | 2023-11-07-exist %} in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.
These people are struggling for viable [ways to exist](https://youtu.be/DHHqQDKzjTg?si=q_rw9w_xv8P4joQC).

When I first learned of Andrew Tate's popularity with boys and young men, I was not only dismayed but surprised.
Don't we know better already?
But misogyny is not simply a problem of ignorance.
It and other expressions of violence are tools for [acting out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_out) feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.
To get rid of these kinds of abhorrent behavior, we have to address the source of the problem.

Instead of offering gender-agnostic advice for self-actualization, [Christine Emba](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/), like psychotherapist [Stephen A. Shapiro](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stephen_A._Shapiro) in the past, is trying to champion positive, overtly masculine roles:
> In my ideal, the mainstream could embrace a model that acknowledges male particularity and difference but doesn’t denigrate women to do so. It’s a vision of gender that’s not androgynous but still equal, and relies on character, not just biology. And it acknowledges that certain themes — protector, provider, even procreator — still resonate with many men and should be worked with, not against.

I wonder whether this is an ideal towards which we should strive or whether it is merely a stepping stone aiming to stabilize male self-esteem as it approaches an ultimate destination.
No matter where we are on this journey, it needs to be somewhere where the male ego doesn't feel in danger.
Because, if it does, men will return again and again to the familiar coping strategy of domination, which assuages their fear of the deepest inferiority: worthlessness.
