I have a knack for picking up new books even while I have already a few on the go.
Eschewing reading etiquette in this way amuses me as if it were actual mischief.
<!--more-->
It also does a lot to maintain and continually rekindle my reading appetite.
My main book is _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, which I've been reading since last fall.
I'm about 75% done, but taking my time, letting the ideas marinate and noticing {% vbook_post how they apply | 2024-04-07-walk %} nowadays.

With Libby and Spotify, it's easy to try out audiobooks, which are great for listening while doing activities with low mental demand like driving, cooking, and cleaning.
Recently I sampled [_Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest), because it is about a topic I'm {% vbook_post very interested | 2021-02-01-think-invisibly %} in and was recommended in a [blog post](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours) by Oliver Burkeman, who I admire for his book {% vbook_post _Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals_ | 2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks %}.
_Rest_ was underwhelming and speculative, but thought-provoking.
I {% vbook_post ditched | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} it, but it touched on the concept of the [Default Mode Network](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Default_mode_network), which has been, rather aptly, turning over in the back of my mind.
It was gratifying and intriguing to find a neuoscientific name for a phenomenon that I and many others have intuited.
In fact, I can tell that I am about to fall asleep when I am lying in bed and notice that my imagination has taken a life of its own, and that my conscious mind has left the director's chair for a seat in the audience.

On the other side of the spectrum of ditchability are David Graeber's books about [debt](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years) and [bureaucracy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Utopia_of_Rules:_On_Technology,_Stupidity,_and_the_Secret_Joys_of_Bureaucracy), which I've been listening to on Spotify and am thrilled to have discovered.
I only learned of Graeber last year and my expectations were low when I began listening to his book about [_Bullshit Jobs_](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bullshit_Jobs), but recently I've started thinking he may have been one of the most interesting intellectuals of recent times.
I want to get physical copies of his books and re-read them studiously, delving into topics he covers to test his judgment and theories, which I find insightful and very intriguing, if at times radical.

Otherwise, I've been picking up books on topics that relate with things going on in my life and in my head.
Having recently returned from a {% vbook_post trip to nyc | 2024-05-26-nyc-trip %}, I finally cracked open my copy of [_Destinations_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations) to read Jan Morris's lovely piece about Manhattan.
Also, I resumed Gloria Steinem's [_Revolution From Within_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within), since I've been thinking a lot about self-esteem and ego.
Steinem's reference to Alice Miller's [_The Drama of the Gifted Child_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4887.The_Drama_of_the_Gifted_Child) sent me on a reading tangent about Miller's initial advocacy for Konrad Stettbacher's version of [primal therapy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Primal_therapy) and her eventual [denouncement](https://www.primals.org/articles/amiller.html).
Out of curiosity, I searched for New Yorker articles mentioning Alice Miller and ended up reading [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/drawn-from-life) about Bechdel, whom I only knew in relation to the [Bechdel test](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bechdel_test).

I also started reading [_remembered rapture_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51409.remembered_rapture), bell hooks's essays on writing, which is a topic I think about constantly.
This in turn led me to Zora Neale Hurston's [_Their Eyes Were Watching God_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37415.Their_Eyes_Were_Watching_God), which bell hooks cites as one of the literary treasures recovered from obscurity by second wave feminism.
In fact, according to Wikipedia, new interest in Hurston's work was sparked in 1975 by an article published in _Ms._ â€“ Gloria Steinem's magazine!

Reading {% vbook_post like this | 2023-01-28-choose-your-next-book %} is so much fun and, for me, a much more {% vbook_post efficient | 2020-01-12-ditch-books %} use of my reading appetite.
