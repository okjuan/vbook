Notes on style and process of writing [The Virtual Book](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360).
<!--more-->

This piece has been the hardest to write so far.
The seed of the idea came in early 2021.
The tentative title: _Making the Internet Surf Itself_.
Then, in the summer, I listened to Herbie Hancock’s memoir and, while on a long plane ride, drafted an outline for the piece on my phone.
Despite my efforts, the piece felt near-dead by Christmas time.
It read too much like an outline, or a list of ideas.
I was tempted to avert my gaze and scurry away.

The passing of time was discouraging, but also fuelling.
I accumulated more references and examples.
Reading Gail Sheehy’s memoir and watching Wes Anderson’s _The French Dispatch_ introduced me to magazine journalism of the 60s and 70s.
I started reading compilations of old articles.
I subscribed to the New Yorker.
At the same time, I was watching more video essays and Andrew Callaghan’s content on YouTube.
All this made the piece more exciting and more challenging to write: Can I weave all these loosely related topics together? Can I incorporate the new ideas with the old ones?

It was daunting and unnerving, but too big to ignore now, over a year in the making.
My mental elephant in the room.
In the spring of the new year, I decreed Saturday mornings Writing Time.
Come summer, I was ready to let it go.
It’s been a relief to get it out there, finally clearing the space in my head and my conscience.
