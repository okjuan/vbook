> Theatre takes place all the time, wherever one is. And art simply facilitates persuading one this is the case.

This is a quote by John Cage that I encountered in _The Medium is the Massage_, professor Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore's idiosyncratic book.
I thought immediately of my piece {% vbook_post _how to live in the moment #2_ | 2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2 %}, where I talk about art as a means for capturing special moments of everyday life.

Until recently, every time I encountered a quote by an artist that echoed something I'd written, I would eagerly try to incorporate the quote into my piece retroactively.
I did this multiple times to [_The Invisible Thinker_](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-invisible-thinker-c5ee42b4bb5) with quotes from David Lynch, Cormac McCarthy, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
The quotes were relevant, but I came to regret inserting them into a piece I might already consider whole.
It's difficult to make changes to a finished piece while preserving its flow and cohesion.

So I've been thinking about this problem.
How to collect quotes and connect them to existing pieces without forcing on them undue modifications.
Here is a new kind of attempt.
