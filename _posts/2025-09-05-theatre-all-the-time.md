> Theatre takes place all the time, wherever one is. And art simply facilitates persuading one this is the case.

This is a quote by John Cage that I encountered in _The Medium is the Massage_, professor Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore's idiosyncratic book.
I thought immediately of my piece {% vbook_post _how to live in the moment #2_ | 2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2 %}, where I talk about art as a means for capturing special moments of everyday life.

In the past, every time I've encountered a quote by an artist that echoes something I've written, I try hard to retroactively incorporate the quote into my piece.
I did this multiple times to [_The Invisible Thinker_](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-invisible-thinker-c5ee42b4bb5) with quotes from David Lynch, Cormac McCarthy, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
But eventually I regretted it.
The quotes were relevant, but it was difficult to insert them without disrupting the flow of the finished piece.

So I've been thinking about this problem.
How to collect quotes and connect them to existing pieces without forcing undue modifications.
Here is one a new kind of attempt.
