I wasn't particularly satisfied with Randolph's writing skills, but the book made for an entertaining 1st person account of the birth of Netflix.

Compared to memoirs like {% post_url_with_hover_card Educated | 2020-04-26-educated %} and _Becoming_, this book doesn't paint a vivid image of what it was like to be the author at a particular part of their life.

Moreover, as a reader, I feel like I'm hearing Randolph reminisce and indulge casually about his time as Netflix CEO and President.
He muses somewhat lazily about lessons one can take away from his experiences.
I think the author could've asked himself bolder, more incisive questions about himself and his role at Netflix.
Even though I found the book interesting and enjoyable, I am left feeling that Randolph relied too much on the success of Netflix to make this book worth while.
