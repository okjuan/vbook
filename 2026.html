<h3 id="january">January</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 11 2025</em> –
I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.
Change it not majorly, but minorly.
I intend to live in the same place, work the same job, drink the same coffee.
But I want to sharpen my focus.
I intend to withhold my attention a bit more and marshall it with more discipline towards things that matter.
That doesn’t mean I will scold myself if I waste time or spend it on unimportant things.
But I want to try everyday to dedicate <em>more</em> attention to things that matter, to things that will accumulate rather than disappear into the void like jewelry into the drain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I will continue resisting idealistic aspirations towards abstract virtue, but will try to submit myself to disciplines that I trust will render concrete results.
Spending more time reading.
Waking earlier.
Avoiding cheap distractions that undermine opportunities to spend time meaningfully.
I’m not so interested in deeming time spent scrolling on instagram or passively consuming recommended YouTube videos as immoral.
It is not bad to produce nothing or learn nothing for a few minutes on a random day, but it is costly to let it become a habit.
Costly in time and in opportunity.
I don’t believe I’m particularly special but I do think there is a version of me at eightysomething years old that looks back with some sastifaction at his life’s work.
I want to do something meaningful and I know the steady progress of minutes hours and days can lead to things that irregular bouts of inspiration can imagine but never produce.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>January 11 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-7">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 18 2025</em> –
Winter in the PNW has been unusually dry and sunny.
It’s beautiful, and joyful if you don’t stop to think about the disastrous climactic changes it might portend.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>January 22 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-8">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Over the last few days I’ve been rereading all my <a href="/vbook/now">/now</a> updates starting from the </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-1">first one</a><p> in November ‘23.
I’ve been journaling in various forms for years now and still I am surprised by its usefulness.
It’s so easy to forget our moods and modes, our thoughts and experiences.
I maintain that journaling is a way to live longer.
Through it and through intangible other forms of reflection I am determined to defeat the notions that time flies, that life is short.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back at what I appended to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-7"><em>what I’m doing now #7</em></a><p> on January 14th, a mere two and a half months ago, I am taken aback by what I wrote:</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’d forgotten this.
This is one of the joys of writing.
Most things I write I leave for a couple weeks while I occupy myself with new ideas only to come back to the old ones and find myself yet again intrigued and surprised by what this person who I supposedly am had to say.</p></div>

<h3 id="february">February</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 18 2025</em> –
In early February we have a couple plans for gatherings with friends.
We also intend to visit Victoria.
I look forward to it.
I’m realizing I have a positive association with February.
Perhaps because it’s the month when we usually get snow in the PNW and for a couple days our surroundings are awash in white, soft and bright.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>February 1 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-9">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
As foretold the annual snowdump came down in February, this time on the very first evening of the month.
For people like me that rely on outdoor sports like soccer and biking for exercise it’s rather inconvenient but that inconvenience is more than repaid in stunning views of snowcovered mountains looming above the clouds, lit in the early sunset.
Not to mention the ease with which one could drive up one of those mountains for a weekday evening of skiing in Vancouver.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I go on leisurely trudges through the neighborhood to soak up the scene.
A few blocks from our apartment I encounter a middleaged man working with a shovel.
I don’t know his name but I’ve seen him on my walks in the spring and summer tending to a neighborhood garden in the nearby rotunda.
Today he is on the sidewalk scraping off snow and peppering blue salt into the gash as if to cauterize it.
I greet him and he responds with a grin.
<em>Living the dream!</em> he says.
On the roads his mechanized counterpart heaves aside mounds of snow effortlessly and from its back showers a trail of salt.
I walk ten minutes to one of the sushi restaurants in the area to pick up my lunch.
Too hungry to wait until I get home I pause and stand beneath the awning outside the restaurant and drink my miso soup and watch the neighborhood go on without me on its natural rhythm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>June 24 2025</em> –
The decision Z and I made in February to upgrade apartments in Vancouver was a brilliant one.
For a while, we’d been pining for a second bedroom.
Because we both work from home most of the time, our one bedroom apartment was proving to be an uncomfortable fit.
So every few months I would scan Facebook Marketplace for rentals and we even visited a few, but we never found anything good enough.
Then, one evening, after watching a YouTube video about rent decline in Canadian cities, I searched again.
This time, I found one option that looked good.
A few days later we went to the open house and that same afternoon we submitted our application.
Z was anxious and hesitant about making the change but with the passing of time it has only gotten clearer that our decision was a good one.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The move improved our lives substantially.
With the second bedroom we gained not only a separate workspace but also a room to host family and friends.
Also, our new apartment is in a fantastic location, mere steps off The Drive.
We have within a five minute walk grocery stores, parks, a public library, a community centre, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, stores, thrift shops, boutiques, and so on.
This was no accident.
In the summer of 2023, we spent a couple days driving around Vancouver in search of the neighborhood in which we’d most want to live.
This one was the winner.
Twenty months later, the opportunity arose and we pounced.</p></div>

<h3 id="march">March</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
I have loose plans to watch <em>Mickey 17</em> with friends when it comes out in theaters.
It was written and directed by Bong Joon-Ho, who directed and cowrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)"><em>Parasite</em></a>, one of the most renowned films of recent times.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>March 8 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-10">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="april">April</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 25 2025</em> –
This spring has been a turbulent time for me.
For several weeks issues of immigration and taxes have harried my mind mercilessly.
They are the kind of issues I wish I could banish from my life forever.
They are meaningless problems that threaten retaliation not by a person but by an amorphous, impersonal entity of brute force and unreckonable reach.
The task is not so much facing reality but placating a selfappointed arbiter of it.
To avoid these problems is to risk persecution from the world itself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Unlike interpersonal problems, these allow little opportunity for persuasion or compromise or compassion, unless a not-fully-dehumanized bureaucrat sneaks some in between the paperwork.
The main recourse is just that – paperwork.
For people in my situation that means hiring my own (expensive) functionaries to prepare papers that will please the faraway and faceless adversarial functionaries so that they in turn dissuade their armed counterparts from deploying violence on me.
But fear not!
For our underdog has been schooled in the art of reading instructions carefully and filling out answers dutifully even for questions absurd or irrelevant.
He knows how to deal in this horrible cypher of ink and paper to earn whatever prized document he needs to secure passage between manufactured realities and to live a life unhounded inside them.
Let’s not dwell on those not so well prepared or those of lesser means.</p></div>

<h3 id="may">May</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
May is the month the European soccer season climaxes.
Crowned are the winners of leagues and cups alike.
Arsenal, the team I support, are still in the running for two major honors: the English Premier League (EPL) and the UEFA Champions League.
Two days ago they defeated the reigning EPL champions by a whopping and unforeseeable 5-1 scoreline.
And yet our biggest competitor this season is not them, but Liverpool, who are six points ahead of us with a game in hand.
In early May, Arsenal will go to northern England and duel them at Anfield, Liverpool’s fortress.
<em>That</em> will probably be Arsenal’s biggest match of the season.
I start to feel a bit queasy thinking about it now, three months ahead.
It’s shocking how thrilling it is even from a thousand miles away to support a sports team embroiled in genuine competition.</p></div>

<h3 id="june">June</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>June 1 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-11">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>June 24 2025</em> –
I had a moment last week when I realized I was finally out of the woods.
There are no longer any tax and immigration issues for me to address.
The tallest wave has come and gone and I’ve not drowned.
It sounds melodramatic but I was in physical pain for much of the spring.
The patch of excema that flared on my left hand appears on its way to recovery.
I can breathe a ragged sigh of relief.
I feel free to let my mind loose again.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, my most pressing concerns are meaningful ones.
Z and I have a London trip to plan.
And before that, perhaps also a small anniversary weekend away together.
And when July arrives, my focus will be on enjoying the two whole months of uninterrupted sunny weather we get in the PNW.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There’s also the question of where we will live next year.
It could be Seattle or New York if Z gets her long awaited green card, or it could be somewhere in Europe – the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany.
We’ll see.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(While writing the above, it occured to me that this experiment of “</p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/writing-2025">live journaling</a><p>” could expand its scope beyond the current year.
The piece might be called <em>what I’m doing in my life</em> and it could be dense with references to other pieces, including this one.)</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 2 2025</em> –
Yesterday evening in our hotel room in Merida Z turned over to me and proposed a deal.
If we stay in Vancouver can we get a second dog?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before she met me, Z had a plan.
She would finish her degree, go to Indonesia for a few months, then move to Toronto.
But then we happened, and our single lives were suddenly compromised.
I spent an unplanned year in Victoria, then she spent a year commuting to Seattle to visit me.
After I got my green card, I started commuting with her part of the time.
A year later, we got her an apartment in Vancouver and started spending most of our time there.
Another year and a half later we swapped her apartment for a bigger one in a neighborhood in Vancouver that we love.
Years of adjustment and compromise have passed and we find ourselves living a life neither of us imagined but a happy one nonetheless.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All the while have endured Z’s intentions to venture out of the PNW.
And if our circumstances had made it feasible I believe we would have done it.
We might have moved to NYC if Z had been granted her green card.
We might have moved to Toronto or somewhere in Europe if it did not jeopardize my immigration status in the US.
We had no shortage of exciting ideas.
The latest one was to move somewhere for a year where Z could do a masters degree.
We considered places in Europe but then Z learned that studying in Canada would be more conducive to her career goals.
So that narrowed down the attractive options to Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the last few months Z has ruminated privately on what she wanted.
And finally she has determined, I think somewhat to her surprise, that she doesn’t want to move.
She wants to be home.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I have a similar feeling.
My appetite for novelty and change has been supplanted by a desire for steadiness and routine.
I like my job, I like my hobbies, I like my friends, I like my life.
I don’t feel like I need to go out and look for a new life.
I have a good one, and what I want most is to spend time in it.
I want to deepen, expand from within.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I have found trust that new experiences and new places are in our future.
No doubt parenthood will slow us down but it will also spring us into new adventures.
Perhaps we’ll take our kids to live in Mexico City for a year.
Perhaps Indonesia.
Who knows.
I’m looking forward to finding out.</p></div>

<h3 id="july">July</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Spring is springing and I’m already looking forward to paddleboard season.
Many of our friends in Seattle own paddleboards and we all go out on the lake regularly in July and August.
I expect this summer we will spend many more hours out on the water.
I’m also looking forward to Sports Days – afternoons we spend in the park playing volleyball and soccer, listening to music, snacking, and drinking cold beverages.
And a new tradition I anticipate will involve lots of leisurely communal outdoor time in the backyard of the house that my friend owns and a bunch of us live in.
It’s going to be great.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>July 2 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-12">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
Last week, Z and I went paddleboarding for the first and I’m afraid perhaps the only time this year.
We bought paddleboards in August of 2022 and have been enjoying them every summer in Seattle since then.
For two and a half years, I had an apartment in Capitol Hill, a six minute drive up the incline from Lake Union.
At some point, we discovered Terry Petus Park, a lovely little lakeside spot tucked beside the houseboat neighborhood in Eastlake.
In the summers, we’d go down there with friends and launch into Lake Union from the treeshaded dock and spend a few hours out on the water chatting, drinking, and listening to music.
Even our little dog Baxter – wearing his little life jacket adorned with a foam shark fin – came out on the paddleboards with us.
Whenever friends or family visited in the summer we brought them with us.
My older sister absolutely loved it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In late 2024, I moved into my friend’s house in West Seattle, and nowadays Z and I spend more time in Vancouver.
We haven’t tried paddleboarding in Vancouver yet, but we expect it to be less convenient.
There is far less access to lakes than in Seattle, where it is abundant.
The biggest problem, however, is that Z and I are going to the UK for most of August.
Come September the warmth will evaporate rather quickly.
Oh well.
You can’t have it all.</p></div>

<h3 id="august">August</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Some friends and I are thinking of taking a trip to the San Juan Islands or to some other natural destination in the region.
If indeed we do so in August it may coincide with some of our birthdays.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
Z and I have booked a trip to England and Ireland.
We’re going to Dublin, County Clare, County Kerry, Bristol, &amp; London.
We also intend to visit Bath and Cornwall.
It’s going to be great.
In London, we are going to attend Arsenal vs Leeds.
I’ve never attended an Arsenal match.
Watching them play a Premier League game at the Emirates Stadium will be a dream come true.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>August 6, 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-13">now</a><p>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>August 28, 2025</em> –
What I’m doing </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-14">now</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>August 31, 2025</em> –
Finally, in the last few days before leaving on my trip with Z to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/ireland">Ireland</a><p> and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/england">England</a><p>, I repotted </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/restraint-2">my plants</a><p>.
Ideally I would have done it in the spring so that they’d flourish during their natural season of growth but I put it off, feeling too encumbered mentally and emotionally by immigration and tax paperwork I had to do.
I despaired for weeks and found myself yearning for a simpler life established in a single place where my presence is never in question and where my household chores feel under control.
But I have since come out of that period of distress and done so without making any sacrifices or compromises, though it would be wise to make some now while life feels manageable.
I dread that another similar period of adversity will come, and then I realize no doubt it will.
To be sure some sources of worry and anguish I will eliminate or neutralize but then new ones will spring up in due time.
One cannot live without risk, cannot have anything without the threat of loss and the burden of maintaining it.
And the greater the blessing bestowed, the greater the fear to lose it imposed.
There is no hope to banish suffering and to live.
But there is courage to face it, composure to remain steady, judiciousness to know which gifts are worth accepting, and restraint to denounce the ones that encumber more than they enrich.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="september">September</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Paul Thomas Anderson’s new movie comes out in September.
He is one of my favorite directors and film writers.
I really enjoyed <em>Licorice Pizza</em> in theatres and <em>There Will Be Blood</em> is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen.
I have multiple friends who would also be excited to see his newest work in theatres.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>September 8 2025</em> –
September has begun dusty, gray, and ugly in our part of the world.
The smoke of notso distant forest fires dulls the sky into a hazy lifeless blue and the sunlight into an unnatural orange.
For me September usually induces nostalgia.
The month of bittersweet transition from untethered joy of summer to the cool and quiet comforts of fall.
A return to routine and predictability.</p></div>

I have several friends who work at Microsoft as I do and a few months ago one of them said he’s seen “too many surveys” broadcasted internally about our company’s flexible work policy and that he suspected that the company was preparing to retract permission allowing employees to work from home.
I had no such inkling.
Five years had already passed since Covid had established the norm of working remotely and while other tech giants like Amazon and Google had enforced a partial return to office in 2023, Microsoft had maintained its flexible work policy.
It seemed silly to think Microsoft might change their policy now, two years later.
I figured my friend was being paranoid or defensively pessimistic, but a few weeks later I asked my manager’s manager about it and he confirmed that our EVP had recently indicated that an update to the company’s flexible work was incoming.
Gulp.
So after five and a half years of working remotely, I face the prospect of resuming regular commute to a suburban corporate campus and losing the comforts and conveniences of working from my own home.
The company is willing to make exceptions for certain reasons but not due to my personal work preferences, even if though my performance has consistently exceeded expectations.
I am assured that survey data indicates I will Thrive More and Deliver Greater Business Impact by collaborating with my peers in person.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>September 25 2025</em> –
Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets begin encroaching on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the daytime sky, we have September.
A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.
An easing from the hectic activity of summertime and a brief refuge from holidays that demand shopping, planning, traveling, socializing, all in very particular modes.
It might be my favorite month of the year.
And yet it depends on the others for contrast because twelve Septembers would be too many.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 7 2025</em> –
The first rains of September fell modestly and seldom so I went about my business as if summer went on as well.
On a sunny Saturday afternoon I strapped my pitching wedge and putter onto the frame of my bike in a way that seemed to me clever and economical and I set out on my usual path towards the center of town.
I rode onto the main road and down its gentle slope.
As I came to the stoplight it changed in my favor.
No traffic headed in my direction.
I cruised into the intersection with my left arm raised to signal and arced my path slowly to the left until my backtire slid out from beneath me and I crashed onto the asphalt.
From every direction alarmed pedestrians called out <em>Are you ok?</em> and as I got up and collected my bike I assured each one that I was.
I pushed my bike out of the road and to confirm I was indeed ok a guy my age approached me in that crouching posture people assume to offer help to stricken strangers.
After I confirmed I was ok he nodded and lowered his outstretched palm and straightened back up as he turned away.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
I saw somebody wearing a motorcycle helmet adorned with big furry rabbit ears and it reminded me of <em>Donnie Darko</em>.
I watched it for the first time in the summer of 2023 and I want to watch it again.
It occurred to me that I should host a series of spooky movie viewings in October.
We could watch one per week and let friends know ahead of time so they have it in their plans for October.
I’d probably show a David Lynch film, too.</p></div>

In the spirit of living with forethought and premeditation, I suggested to my mom that we begin planning a post-Christmas trip to Mexico or Honduras, somewhere warm.
In years past I’ve intended to buy flights for the holiday season months in advance but never managed it.
Hopefully this year.</p></div>

On condition that we go to Indonesia in the spring of 2026 to see her maternal family, Z has agreed to visit Mexico for Christmas of this year.
I’m excited to explore the Yucatan peninsula, a part of Mexico I’ve never seen.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>December 15 2025</em> —

<p>My live journal </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/2025"><em>what I’m doing in 2025</em></a><p> is another experiment inspired by the ideas I originally explored in my essay <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360"><em>The Virtual Book</em></a>.
<!--more-->
One of the attributes of “</p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual books</a><p>” that most intrigues me is their <strong>dynamism</strong>, the fact that they can change over time.
It excites me not only for its practicality, but for the artistic possibilities it enables.
As I wrote originally in <em>The Virtual Book</em> and then reproduced in </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/show-instead-of-telling">one</a><p> of its separated pieces on this site:</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this journal I intend to do something like the hypothetical memoirist.
Throughout the year, whenever I feel so inclined, I will write here about events that might happen, are happening, or have happened in 2025.
I think it will be interesting to juxtapose my expectations, experiences, and reflections throughout the year.
I hope it will neutralize the bias we typically grant hindsight, which is a privileged perspective but not a consummate one.</p></div>

Today I fly back up north.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 21 2026</em> –
Looking westward over the neighborhood park as I walk to the grocery store I see below streaks of pink and blue the Vancouver skyline peeking coyly out of a fog it wears like a fur coat.
When it’s in this mood the city feigns no modesty about its good looks.</p></div>

<h3 id="february">February</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Microsoft expects all employees living within a fifty mile radius of the headquarters in Redmond to be present in office an average of three days per week.
The new rule was announced in September 2024 and it takes effect at the end of February.
And so tens of thousands of employees will begin commuting to campus to do the job they’ve been doing at home for the last six years.</p></div>

<h3 id="march">March</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
March will mark four years since I transferred from Excel to Loop.</p></div>

<h3 id="june">June</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Soon after June begins, the World Cup will begin as well.
The first in the Americas in my lifetime.
I don’t have a bucket list but if I did Attend the World Cup would certainly be on it.</p></div>

<h3 id="july">July</h3>

<h3 id="august">August</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Z is preparing applications for graduate programs at universities across Canada.
Depending on where she is accepted, August will likely be our month for settling into a new home.
It will also be the month I turn thirty.
I don’t feel anxiety about it, at least not yet.
We’ll see how I feel as the date approaches.
I’m in good shape for it though, I think.
Married, gainfully employed, established in my career, financially secure, spending time on things I care about.
I am as I probably should be – satisfied with my life’s yield, enjoying the fruits of my university labors.
I was greatly privileged by the opportunities afforded me and I took them.
While I was in school and for years thereafter I saw Computer Science degrees as a surefire catapult into stable and lucrative employment.
Hell, for me it served as runway for easy immigration into the USA.
It is only in retrospect that I appreciate that even the timing of my graduation in 2019 was fortunate.
It was a sellers market.
Even people with minimal education and experience in programming were getting job offers.
It was a gold rush.
It peaked in 2021 and since then it has been correcting.
In wave after wave thousands upon thousands of employees have been laid off over the last few years not by failing startups but by huge and enormously profitable tech companies.
I transferred within Microsoft from Excel to Loop in March of ‘23.
Loop was recruiting openly within the Office organization and all management levels above me were promoting “talent mobility.”
Layoffs had begun happening at Microsoft and in the industry at large, but it felt like a distant threat.
And yet one of my fellow engineers at Excel passed up the opportunity to join Loop because he feared that new recruits would be likely targets if layoffs continued.
I figured he didn’t have much to worry about.
Two years later, however, layoffs did reach us.
But the affected employees turned out to be those with <em>most</em> years of service at Microsoft.</p></div>

<h3 id="september">September</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
If by September I continue working at Microsoft I will complete seven years of work there, and nearly two as a senior engineer.</p></div>

<h3 id="october">October</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 28 2025</em> –
Again next year I will organize spooky movie viewings at home with friends.
I’m not big into Halloween or anything but I love movies and it feels nice to let the season influence my activities.
The rain and the cold and the dark of fall ushers us into the soft warmth of living rooms to spend time in restful company of friends and loved ones.
When it comes to picking a spooky movie, it doesn’t matter to me that it adhere to the theme of Halloween.
To me it matters much more that it is first of all a good movie and secondly that it creates a moody, eerie atmosphere.
Some friends of mine are sticklers for a theme.
Last October (2024) they put on some Halloween-y music and I queued <em>Brujas</em> by Princess Nokia because it means <em>Witches</em> in Spanish and because it has a dark, moody vibe.
They were bewildered – <em>who put on hip hop?</em>
They restored order by skipping to <em>Monster Mash</em>.
Then they followed up with some spooky sounds like Chains Rattling and Wolf Howling and stuff like that.
I don’t know, for me, the point is to to set an enjoyable mood with enjoyable music.
Who cares how many lateral steps you take?
In <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2m7AVWn6qXUx2y7Ek6BIFd?si=611ba661a9d14a9b">my Halloween playlist</a> I take several to round up good tracks like <em>Scared Money</em> by NxWorries and <em>Time of the Season</em> by The Zombies.
I’ll admit it’s a pretty crude mix still.
But I’ve forgotten to work on it for the last several Halloweens.
Maybe next year.</p></div>
