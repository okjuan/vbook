Watching a class movie is tricky.
It's hard to put aside the mental associations that accumulate around it over time.
Hard not to expect a stereotypical movie based on the real life archetype who most often says to you, in almost moral indignation, _You haven't seen it?_

_Fight Club_, for example, I didn't see until a year or two ago.
I could've watched it much earlier but I was never in the mood for the oblivious male fable I assumed it would be due to the thoughtless joke -- "first rule of Fight Club..." -- that blared out of the lips of so many men like they were automatons with a preprogrammed response that was activated by an annoyingly broad variety of inputs.
It's like the taste-agnostic regurgitations of "Keep Calm and..." splattered across posters, mugs, t-shirts, anything with a surface that can be cheaply marketed as souvenirs or house art.
You overlook the seriousness of the original context: Churchill's state trying to reassure and inspire English citizens amid nothing short of a WORLD WAR.
But its co-option into soulless tat has robbed it of its meaning and spirit.

The Sopranos.
Fight Club.
Shawshank Redemption.
