TODO: rewrite this review. It would be ok to write retrospectively, especially since this book influenced me a lot.

Overall, the book had some illuminating ideas to share early on, but many others that came later disappointed.

The format is fun: in each chapter, Bayard recounts novels that in some way relate to his point.

Bayard creates a small set of words to define and characterize his ideas, but they prove flimsy when he builds on his convictions, seemingly straying from believability more and more with each claim.
