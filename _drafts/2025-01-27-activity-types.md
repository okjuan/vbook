- while digesting a meal, I am often too lethargic to exert effort comfortably
    - (some might ask: how important is it to be _comfortabe_ while making effort?)
    - don't overeat!
    - do mindless activities like empty dishwasher, make coffee, clean kitchen, do laundry, etc

- while in a low-demand meeting
    - great time to do mindless activities like empty dishwasher, make coffee, clean kitchen, do laundry, etc
- while in a high-demand meeting
    - trivial activities like pacing or wiping glasses are _too distracting_
