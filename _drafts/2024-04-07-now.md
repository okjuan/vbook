### Life

My weight loss progressed has stalled.
I'm 15lbs lighter than I was in June of last year but the red needle on my bathroom scale has been trembling at the same position for weeks.
I'm playing soccer twice a week now, but going on fewer walks.
I am mindful about what I eat, but I don't track it.
I said in my {% post_url_with_hover_card last update | 2024-02-19-now %} that I would try not finishing my serving just because it’s served, but even with the goal in mind I find it very difficult to do.
Years ago I saw an ad for a habit-focused weight loss app called Noom that said that finishing your plate is often an impulse ingrained in childhood.
I think that's true for me.
In any case, I suspect my biggest hurdle to further weight loss is snacking before bedtime.
I'd still like to lose another 25lbs, but I think I'm going to put it on the backburner for now.
Cruise until I catch a second wind.

Like I mentioned, I'm playing soccer twice a week.
7v7 games, mostly.
My cardio is not amazing, but definitely much better than it was at the start of the year.

I've gone snowboarding twice.
Finally!
Once at Cypress Mountain on a weekday evening and once at Mt Seymour on a weekend afternoon.
Both are within a thirty minute drive from Vancouver, which is incredible.
The season is coming to an end but I'm hoping to go to Grouse Mountain soon, which is less than twenty minutes away from Vancouver.
And I thought Seattle's access to ski resorts was impressive.

I keep watching Arsenal games and they keep winning.
Arteta is undeniably effective.
His decisions are questionable sometimes, but so far he has managed to produce answers for them.
Arsenal is poised to win the Premier League, but the margin of error afforded by Liverpool and Manchester City is negligible.
Everyone is thrilled to have three title contenders with only seven games left and nobody can predict who will win it.

I've also been working on the decor of our apartment.
I put up small floating shelves in our bedroom, which was intimidating because I was afraid to drill holes for wall anchors.
Bought a mirror for our plant corner in the living room.
Bought a rubber plant, a ficus elastica.
Continually propagating my pothos snippings and planting them in nursery pots.
In addition to Never Too Small, which I've been watching for years now, I've started watching videos by [Noah Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/@noahdaniel.studio), a small new YouTuber who is an interior designer with a passion for [modern architecture](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Modern_architecture) and design.

Z and I have been {% post_url_with_hover_card exploring the neighborhoods | 2024-04-07-walk %} around us and loving it.
Occasionally I go for a long nighttime walk on my own, as I have done for years, and a recent one resulted in Z and I getting tickets to see {% post_url_with_hover_card exploring Vieux Farka Touré | 2024-04-07-vieux-farka-toure %}.
It turned out to be one of the live music performances I've most enjoyed attending.

TODO: Improv.

### Travel

Diversity and variety must exist like nowhere else in New York City.
Z and I are going in May.
Also, we're going to Tofino for my mom's birthday soon.

### Work

A couple weeks ago I silently celebrated my two year anniversary working on Microsoft Loop.
It's the longest I've worked on a single product or team and by far the one I've enjoyed the most.
The problems are interesting, the work is in line with my career goals, the product is exciting, the people are great, the work life balance is stellar.

Although I had a dip in motivation several weeks ago, I've been quite motivated recently.
Managing one's motivation is a nonobvious and little discussed but essential skill.
Over the years I've recognized it as such and tried to improve at it.

### Coding

I implemented hoverboxes on this site!
If you're on a computer, hover over {% post_url_with_hover_card this link | 2024-02-19-now %} and you'll see a preview of my previous 'now' update.
It was nontrivial but educational to implement.
I've always liked the idea of doing DIY.
Does this count?

I haven't worked on my app [**Muze Radio**](https://okjuan.me/muze-radio) for a couple months.
Spotify denied my request for an [extended quota](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/rate-limits), which would allow anyone with Spotify Premium to use it.
I addressed their silly reason and resubmitted the request.
It's been just over six weeks, which is their expected turnaround time.
On the Spotify Dashboard, I see a message banner stating that _The review is taking longer than expected_.
Yeah, I know.
I suppose I can't be too annoyed though.
It's free.
Once they accept my request for my app, I'll probably have motivation to resume work on it.
