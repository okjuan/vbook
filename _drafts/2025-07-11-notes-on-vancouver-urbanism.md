Here are some things I've noticed in the last couple of weeks while watching recordings of public hearings of the Vancouver City Council.

Each councillor sits behind a computer monitor on which I assume they review the proposal at hand.
It must be much more practical that way than using paper printouts.
The hearings are hybrid meetings:
Microsoft Teams plays a vital role
really cool to see Microsoft products used in important and useful ways

impressed by the attention given to details like "view cones" and "solar areas"

awed that anyone can become a council member if enough people vote for them

amazed at the rhetoric slung by Villagomez on spacing.ca in critique of Uytae's YouTube videos
    I am also suspicious of the things folks from [CityHallWatch](https://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/) say:
        Towers are bad, they make the housing crisis _worse_
        We are urbanists! But no! Stop all this approval of big buildings!

interested to learn how the process of citybuilding works
    a rare occurrence where a strict bureaucratic process does not fill me with dread and resent
    is it a mark of my adulthood that "zoning" make me lean forward in my seat rather than instead of making my eyes glaze over?

a lot of childcare facilities being included in re-zoning applications
    "childcare crisis" was mentioned in a hearing on July 10 2025

the significant influence of relationships between people
    trust and reputation – its weaker, more abstracted cousin – contribute majorly to whether a councilmember believes in a project or not
    e.g. Conwest
    e.g. Brightside
    e.g. specific folks who are known to council

that a small handful of citizens regularly participate in many public hearings – some to exalt, others to wield diatribe
    some insist that towers "belong downtown" and that "misery rains down from" them where built in "neighborhoods"
