Here are some things I've noticed in the last couple of weeks while watching recordings of public hearings held by the Vancouver City Council for rezoning proposals.

I am pleased and encouraged to see Microsoft Teams used to hold public hearings.
City staff, members of the public, and even council members rely on it to participate.
I don't work on Teams, but seeing Microsoft products relied upon for important work is a motivating and heartening reminder that the product I work on is a useful tool.

It amazes me that anyone can become a council member if enough people vote for them.
Hooray for democracy.
Change is possible.
Grassroots movements can go all the way to the top.

I'm impressed by the attention given to topics of aesthetic and leisure.
Specified "view cones" and "solar areas" play a part in determining the height and placement of new buildings.

Even more importantly, the impact on bike streets is carefully considered.
During the public hearing for the infamous Safeway Towers, Councillor Maloney expressed concern that the entrance to the parking garage was on a bike street.
City staff was ready for the question.
The garage was on the north side of the street and the bike lanes were on the south side.
The street runs east to west, so there was no conflict.

As a civilian steps up to the podium to speak, by their appearance alone, you can often guess whether they will be for or against the proposal.
A remarkable portion of the opposition consists of homeowners of middle age.
Young people on the other hand, comprise most of the support.

amazed at the rhetoric slung by Villagomez on spacing.ca in critique of Uytae's YouTube videos
    I am also suspicious of the things folks from [CityHallWatch](https://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/) say:
        Towers are bad, they make the housing crisis _worse_
        We are urbanists! But no! Stop all this approval of big buildings!

interested to learn how the process of citybuilding works
    a rare occurrence where a strict bureaucratic process does not fill me with dread and resent
    is it a mark of my adulthood that "zoning" make me lean forward in my seat rather than instead of making my eyes glaze over?

a lot of childcare facilities being included in re-zoning applications
    "childcare crisis" was mentioned in a hearing on July 10 2025

the significant influence of relationships between people
    trust and reputation – its weaker, more abstracted cousin – contribute majorly to whether a councilmember believes in a project or not
    e.g. Conwest
    e.g. Brightside
    e.g. specific folks who are known to council

that a small handful of citizens regularly participate in many public hearings – some to exalt, others to wield diatribe
    some insist that towers "belong downtown" and that "misery rains down from" them where built in "neighborhoods"

Why don't we have streetcars?
According to Lewis Villegas, they are far cheaper than subways/skytrains and offer greater capacity.

---

Why doesn't the city penalize developers for failing to build?
Are there any ways in which the city combats property speculation and zoning-flips like the kind discussed in [this article](https://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/2025/07/17/flipping-rezoning-receivership-the-saga-of-the-curv-1075-nelson-renger/)?
To what extent is this a problem in Vancouver?

Would I ever live in a tower?
How many people would?
