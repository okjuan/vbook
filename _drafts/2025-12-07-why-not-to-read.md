Often when I'm in my mother's home my attention wanders towards the bookcase.
It sits against the wall below a large window, in the heart of the house.
When I visit I spend most my time in this long room.
It contains the living room, the kitchen, and the dining table.

My attention settles on a particular book and suddenly I want to take it and open it but that impulse gets tempered by a contradictory one.
My mom will see me reading it and encourage me to take it home with me and then I'll have to decline or accept and most likely never open it again.
In any case I dislike traveling with books, worrying about them bending in my bag or water spilling on them.

Often when I'm in my mother's home my attention wanders towards the bookcase.
It sits against the wall below a large window, in the heart of the house.
When I visit I spend most my time in this long room.
It contains the living room, the kitchen, and the dining table.

Often I'll follow my curiosity over to the books.
I've seen many of them before on previous visits, some I've recommended myself, but others I will have never seen before or since forgotten.
For no obvious reason I'll settle on a certain section of the bookcase and eventually on a particular book.
This time, _Haciendas de Mexico_.
We're traveling to Yucatan this winter.

It's a large book and I expected would consist mostly of photographs like the one on the front cover but as soon as I open it I realize it also contains a lot of text.
I resist the impulse to read.
I know enough about myself and my relationship to books to stay mentally aloof.
If I start reading the introduction I'll want to finish it and if I don't I'll feel frustrated and even if I do I may as well feel frustrated any way because I will want to delve deeper and learn about the things the introduction barely gestures at.
