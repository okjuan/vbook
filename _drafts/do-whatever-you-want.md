A not-so-secret desire of mine is to write non-fiction professionally.
To dive into worlds for the sake of experiencing, observing, and understanding them and then responding by creating something.

John McPhee, for example, wrote at length about oranges, the movement of coal across America, the shifting flow of the Mississippi River, and other scintillating topics.

But for now I'm content with working as a software engineer and writing on my own time.
It's [the perfect balance](https://sive.rs/balance).
