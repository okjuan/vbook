In her novel _Normal People_, Sally Rooney grants us privileged access into the interior lives of a young couple.
<!--more-->
We flit between each consciousnessness, witnessing as they withhold from each other and from themselves.
We watch with oscillating delight and despair as they variously succeed and fail to engage honestly with each other and with the truth.
They make mistakes, learn from them, mature, flourish, and fall again at another obstacle.

The most painful parts are those where we as readers see truths that Marianne and Connell yet cannot.
In the first part of the book, we mourn the couple's failure of self-esteem to stand publicly by their relationship.
In the middle part, we rue their inability to recognize the profound meaning of the familial abuse and neglect Marianne has suffered evades both characters.

> If he silently decides not to saying something when they're talking, Marianne will ask "what?" within one or two seconds. This "what?" question seems to him to contain so much: not just the foresnci attentiveness to his silences to allows her to ask in the first place, but a desire for total cojmmjunicatin, a snese that anything unsaid is an unwelcome interruption between them. He writes these things down, long run-on sentences with too many dependent clausese, sometimes connected wit hbreathless semicolons, as if he wants to re-create a precise copy of Marianne in print, as if he can preserve her completely for future review.
