Books about writing can be quite dry. My favorites so far are written with flair. In *Several Short Sentences About Writing*, Klinkerberg says:
> Keep the space between sentences as empty as possible.

I found this idea echoed in John McPhee's *Draft No. 4*:
> The white space that separated [Story A] and [Story B] said things that I would much prefer to leave to the white space to say -- violin phraseology about courage and lack of courage and how they can exist side by side in the human breast.
