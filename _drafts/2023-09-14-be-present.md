I don't find the pop-spiritual mantra "Be present" helpful.
People like to offer it as a balm for negativity.
Don't grumble and complain, look around you and appreciate all the good things.
Be grateful.
Listen to the birds singing and the breeze blowing, soak up the shining sun.

But what if there are no birds, no breeze, and no sun?
What if there are actually very few good things around?
Yes sure my life is good, but this moment sucks.
What if we're in an ugly, windowless room, sitting under fluorescent lighting, forced to listen to some horrible, commercial-infested, brainless radio station playing -- I swear to God -- the same 25 songs every day?

As one of my friends put it, I am always trying to maximize the vibe of the current situation.
As I write this I am sitting on a second floor restaurant balcony overlooking the sunset over the Burrard Inlet in Vancouver's West End.
This was my plan -- to bike along the water, find a place with good outdoor seating and good beer, and to sit with my book or my laptop.
I biked along until I came to a place not only with good ocean scenery but a nice neighborhood feel.
Before sitting down at the restaurant, I made sure they had good craft beer.
This seems like a touristy area, so I'm wary of settling down at a crappy place that relies on tourism for their business.
Before committing to this restaurant, I went up to the waiter and asked what beers they had.
They had a couple good craft options, so I asked if I could sample them before choosing one.
(I love doing this and I never see anyone else doing it. If you taste a free sample before you buy, why wouldn't you?)
After I'd chosen the particular IPA I wanted, I sat outisde at the balcony's edge, overlooking the water.
But when I sat down I realized the sun was in my face and that, if I moved over to a table five feet to my left, the sun would be diffused through a translucent banner hanging on the street lamp.
So I moved.
I sat writing and kept shuffling my seat over a few inches every time the sun, in its angled downward descent, managed to peek around the banner.
Finally, the sun went down (the view is gorgeous), so I moved back to my original seat at the edge of the balcony.

As another one of my friends put it, I'm very particular.
I don't think it's down to compulsiveness or finickiness.
I just want to enjoy my life.

My wife would point out that this isn't the whole picture.
My enthusiasm for good things plummets when they turn bad.
Actually, it plummets earlier, somewhere near the unsatisfactory.

I'm also prone to rage when I find the current situation.
If I don't like the current situation and don't have immediate power to change it, I'll turn to grouchiness or

And yes, I can get very grouchy.

I feel like I've already done much work to connect myself to reality.

I've accepted my mortality without the crutch of afterlife fantasies.
