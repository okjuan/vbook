Cormac filters out unnecessary words from his writing to avoid diluting its potency.
He strips out all but the essential scaffolding words to maintain a high rate of meaningful, descriptive words.

For exammple, consider this bit of the excerpt:
> He kicked his way slowly down the aisle above the seats, his tanks dragging overhead.
> The faces of the dead inches away.

Of 22 words, there are only:
He, his, the, the, his, the, of, the
kicked, way, slowly

> His mother was nineteen when she went to work at Y-12, the electromagnetic separation plant.

> The workers were driven out to the compound in buses, bumping over the rough graded road, through dust or mud given the weather.
> Talking was not allowed.
> The barbed wire fencing ran for miles and the buildings were of solid concrete, massive things, monolithic and for the most part windowless.
> They sat in a great selvage of raw mud beyond which lay a perimeter of the wrecked and twisted trees that had been bulldozed from the site.
> She said it looked as if they had just somehow emerged out of the ground.
> The buildings.
> There was no accounting for them.
> She looked at the other women on the bus but they seemed to have abandoned themselves and she thought that she might be the only one of them that while she did not know what this was about knew all too well that it was Godless and that while it had poisoned back to elemental mud all living things upon that ground yet it was far from being done.
> It was just the beginning.
>
> The buildings held over one thousand miles of pipe and a quarter million valves.
> The women sat on stools and monitored the dials in front of them while uranium atoms raced the tracks in the calutrons.
> Measuring them a hundred thousand times each second.
> The magnets that propelled them were seven feet in diameter and the windings were of solid silver fabricated from fiteen thousands tons of it borrowed from the US Treasury because all the copper had already gone into the war effort.
> An older woman told her that the first day with the women all at their stations and having no least notion what any of this was about the engineers had thrown the consecutive switches and an enormous dynamo hum filled the hall and hairpins in their hundreds shot from the women's heads and crossed the room like hornets.

> Burning people crawled among the corpses like some horror in a vast crematorium.
> They simply thought that the world had ended.
> It hardly even occurred to them that it had anything to do with the war.
> They carried their skin bundled up in their arms before them like wash that it not drag in the rubble and ash and they passed one another mindlessly on their mindless journeyings over the smoking afterground, the sighted no better served than the blind.
> Those who survived would often remember these horrors with a certain aesthetic to them.
> In that mycoidal phantom blooming in the dawn like an evil lotus and in the melting of solid not heretofore known to do so stood a truth that would silence poetry a thousand years.
> Like an immense bladder, they would say.
> Like some sea thing.
> Wobbling slightly on the near horizon.

page 184:
> In his dreams of her she wore at times a smile he tried to remember and she would say to him almost in a chant words he could scarcely follow.
> He knew that her lovely face would soon exist nowhere save in his memories and in his dreams and soon after that nowehere at all.
> She came in half nude trailing sarsenet or perhaps just her Grecian sheeting crossing a stone stage in the smoking footlamps or she would push back the cowl of her robe and her blonde hair would fall about her face as she bent to him where he lay in the damp and clammy sheets and whisper to him I'd have been your shadowlane, the keeper of that house alone wherein your soul is safe.
> And all the while a clangor like the labor of a foundry and dark figures in silhouette about the alchemic fires, the ash and the smoke.
> The floor lay littered with the stillborn forms of their efforts and still they labored on, the raw halfsentient mud quivering red in the autoclave.
> In that dusky penetralium they press about the crucible shoving and gibbering while the deep heresiarch dark in his folded cloak urges them on in their efforts.
> And then what thing unspeakable is this raised dripping up through crust and calyx from what hellish marinade.
> He woke sweating and switched on the bedlamp and swung his feet to the floor and sat with his face in his hands.
> Dont be afraid for me, she had written.
> When has death ever harmed anyone?

He drops apostrophes from contractions like **didnt** but keeps them in **I'm** and **I'll**, presumably to avoid ambiguity.
He never uses semicolons.
Nor does he use quotation marks -- not even in dialogue.
