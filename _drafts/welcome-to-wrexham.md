For the same reason I love episodic story-telling, I love this show.
It often strays from the main story -- whether Wrexham AFC will win promotion to the next division -- to explore little side-stories.j
"The Quiet Zone" (S2E2), for example, is about two people dear to Wrexham who have autism: Millie, an avid fan and former Wrexham youth player, and Albi, son of Wrexham's start goalscorer, Paul Mullin.
Millie goes to all the home games wearing her sound-muffling headphones and sits always in the same spot.
Her routine is possible thanks to Kerry Evans, who Wrexham's Disability Liaison Officer.
We know from Season 1 that Kerry also has a disability and is also an avid Wrexham fan
She had been a full-time volunteer
when Rob and Ryan hired her as staff after five years of doing the job as a full-time volunteer.)
