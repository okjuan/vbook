What is this pleasurable excitement I get sometimes for certain activities and items?
I look at the modest, bronze-colored paperback sitting on my nightside table and it alights in me a special excitement.
Something like the excitement I feel when I think of watching the next episode of a show that I am currently loving.
Or the excitement I have felt in the past when I would think about playing whatever video game I was so enthralled by.

When directed at objects, it is something like a fetish, in the non-sexual sense.
I project onto the entity the excitement that I owe to the experience of doing the activity.
