Okay, I made it. The last episode of the last season of Seinfeld. I pause it so I can go to the shop for some beer. I like making a deal of these things, even if I'm doing them by myself.

The episode opens with Jerry doing the routine stand-up bit. No hint of anything special about this episode; maybe it'll end like The Sopranos. The show is ending. You want a big finale? Too bad, that's not what the point of this show is. We're just here to be funny. This last episode is just one of many.

At the beginning, when Jerry learns that NBC will air his show 'Jerry', I figure the show will end as a loop. The gang live out their lives and then they make a show about their lives. Their story ends with them making a show about their story, so we end where we started. That's cool, but more than one person told me that the finale was crazy. Let's see if they do it with an interesting twist.

Then the gang agree to take NBC's private jet to Paris; Ah, okay, so it will be a feel-good episode where the characters reminisce and savor the end of an era.

### Taunting the Audience
The second-to-last episode gives us the collected gags and blooper reels.

"We're not going to make it a relationship show"
(or whatever it is that George says in the NBC office.)

"I've always loved U--nited Airlines."

The joke about the top button. First and last episode.

George saying "I can't recall at this time" as if he were in court.

### Staying True
I guess, in a way, the finale is similar to the end of The Sopranos. More of the same, but bigger. The Sopranos gave us a long of epic story arcs
The longest, most immersive dream sequence. A thrilling resolution to tensions that have been building not just for ...

Just like The Sopranos, Seinfeld maintains its purpose, subverting our expectations to make that point. It's a situational comedy. It's a series of hilarious situations created by strange luck and absurd behavior. It's a bunch of jokes acted out by funny actors. It's funny. That's it! In that way, it's a show about nothing. It's not a love story with a

Many shows oblige to expectations of the audience. Take shows like Friends, The Office, and The Good Place. Plot only matters because it arms the joke writers.

The whole show is an endless repetition. Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer date new people all the time, but they always break up. George coasts and cheats his way through jobs. Elaine works for a series of kooky, oblivious bosses. Kramer never works; he's always available next door to pop in to add his brand of comedy.

The situations grow more absurd and elaborate for bigger laughs.

But things never progress. Everything is comedy ammunition. This is no story, it's a comedy. We're here to laugh and that's all.

How I Met Your Mother delighted me with a subversive ending. Despite its title, the show was not really the story of how Ted met his kids' mother.

### Character Development
The characters progress to become funnier, ...
In the first few episodes, George is no loser; he even seems cool and assertive. He makes jokes, advises Jerry, works in real estate, reads books, dates women, keeps up with the stock market. He doesn't care that Jerry wants to go after his ex-girlfriend. It surprises him when Jerry calls him an idiot. But then the writers discover how funny George is as a cowardly, pathetic loser. So, for our enjoyment, they exploit it. They explore how this side of George behaves in all sorts of situations. 'The Phone Message', Season 2 Episode 4, shows us ridiculous, inescure George for the first time.

In the next episode, the characters start to take shape.
