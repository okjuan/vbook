Alfred Adler claimed that all problems were interpersonal relationship problems.
Freudian psychoanalysts credit childhood trauma and unconscious drives as fundamental.
Lately I've been thinking about ego and self-image as a gravitational center that grounds our thoughts and behavior.
(Ego is an overloaded term and I've written about {% post_url_with_hover_card my sense | 2023-11-21-ego %} of it.)

I think that the ongoing [male crisis](https://youtu.be/GHkhTIEe254?si=qWMV2Zo8Z6qIQqet) can be articulated in terms of ego and self-esteem.
I suspect the rage many men evidently feel is {% post_url_with_hover_card self-loathing reflected outward | 2023-11-07-exist %} in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.
These people are struggling for viable [ways to exist](https://youtu.be/DHHqQDKzjTg?si=q_rw9w_xv8P4joQC).

When I first learned of Andrew Tate's popularity with boys and young men, I was not only dismayed but surprised.
Don't we know better already?
But misogyny is not simply a problem of ignorance.
It and other expressions of violence are tools for acting out feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.
To get rid of these kinds of abhorrent behavior, we have to address the source of the problem.

Instead of offering gender-agnostic advice for self-actualization, [Christine Emba](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/), like psychotherapist [Stephen A. Shapiro](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stephen_A._Shapiro) in the past, is trying to champion positive, overtly masculine roles:
> In my ideal, the mainstream could embrace a model that acknowledges male particularity and difference but doesn’t denigrate women to do so. It’s a vision of gender that’s not androgynous but still equal, and relies on character, not just biology. And it acknowledges that certain themes — protector, provider, even procreator — still resonate with many men and should be worked with, not against.

I wonder whether this is an ideal towards which we should strive or whether it is merely a stepping stone aiming to stabilize male self-esteem as it approaches an ultimate destination.

One of the problems is that being a Man and therefore being masculine feels like the only option for a male person if they wish to be a valid adult person.
Failure to become a Man can be seen as total failure.
As a consequence, one may obsess with being a Man not because the role truly resonates with them but simply because they want to be of worth.
They want to _feel_ worthy.
They want, like all persons do, to have self-esteem.

I do believe in creating non-generic roles that abide by the specificity of personal attributes.
One of the joys of masculine and feminine images is that they resonate with people, they help them feel actualized.
But what about the actualization of people that cannot live up to these roles because they are either unable or doing so does great harm to their sense of self?
Obviously, this overlaps with the experience of gender-queer people and we should look to them if we wish to understand what actualization looks like beyond the gender binary.
But even within the gender binary there is a major complication: what if a person who envisions themselves as a man cannot live up to the specific role laid out for them?
Can we not simply provide alternative male scripts that do not rely on protection, provider, or procreator?
Clearly these are not enough to offer all people the ability to actualize themselves.

We ought to look to trans and gender-queer people to understand what actualization looks like beyond the gender binary

No matter where we are on this journey, it needs to be somewhere where the male ego doesn't feel in danger.
Because, if it does, men will return again and again to the familiar coping strategy of domination, which miraculously assuages their fear of the deepest inferiority: worthlessness.
