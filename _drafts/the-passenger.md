I would love to see David Lynch interpret this novel in film.

It has so many classic Lynchian ingredients: incest, apparitions,

The Thalidomide Kid: a dwarfish projection of Alicia's psyche that rambles with the incompetent grasp of language that McCarthy often attributed to the human subsconscious.

This novel is like a long, restless dream of ineffable deadlock.
Tension builds along one plotline, but then neither resolves nor dissipates completely.
It remains an anonymous threat hanging over the protagonist Bobby's head, a darkling mystery suspended overhead that never precipitates.

It is never clear who is after Bobby and why.
It seems at first related to his witnessing a suspicious scene in a sunken airplane while working as a salvage diver.
Later, it appears that anonymous authorities are after his father's old papers.
Mysterious men pay visits but never do much other than ask questions.
Some of Bobby's papers are seized.
His cat disappears.
His car get confiscated.
The persecution seems endorsed by or operated through the US government, but it's carried out obliquely and illegitimately.

Bobby seems to live his life as a sort of penance.
All throughout the novel, he is in limbo, with an apparent ambivalence towards life that has him constantly approaching and evading danger, all the while awaiting death.
He camps out in a shed near a deserted beach.
When the threat builds, he flees from New Orleans to Idaho and squats in a derelict house in the freezing cold.
He ends up in the southern coast of Spain, living alone in the loft inside a windmill.
Here, in the quiet, removed from his usual ambit -- eating, drinking, and conversing with friends -- the pitch of his grief reaches shrieking, hallucinatory levels that set the stage for quasi-spiritual moments of revelation.

The most potent aspect of this book is probably its mood, which reflects the hopeless remorse that Bobby feels.
Remorse for the unholy devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that his father and mother helped engineer.
Regret for his helplessness before the great mysteries of mathematics and physical science.
In these Bobby seems to bear the burden not just for himself and his family, but for all of humanity.
Principally, however, Bobby's remorse and grief are for his inability to prevent his sister's suicide and their inability to enact the deep, incestuous love between them.

When he isn't evading his stalkers, he continues living his life in a plain, resigned manner.
He meets and converses with friends.
But he reserves most of his energy for mourning his sister.

Conspiracy and conundrum abound everywhere.
Towards the end of the book, Bobby's lawyer talks at length about a conspiracy theory of the mob's assassination of JFK.

This novel is like a long, restless dream.
It begins with a conundrum that promises an enthralling tale to unfold but then drifts away, still a mystery.
Having chanced across a foreboding scene while working as a salvage diver, Bobby is stalked by nameless officials who seem to suspect his involvement.

Much of the book is this way, haunted by lack, leading always into dead ends and stalling in each new direction it takes.


The book itself teases the reader with its slipperiness.
It is a kludge of unresolved questions and things desparately out of reach.
In the middle of the book we encounter a scene where Bobby, the protagonist, explains to an attentive listener the tribulations of physicists trying to make sense of the world.
Bobby himself is a former academic who fled to physics from mathematics due to his inadequacy and who eventually abandoned physics as well.
His sister -- rendered in the companion novel, Stella Maris -- was even more brilliant and capable of greatness in mathematics, but able neither to maintain her sanity nor her brother's romantic affection.
Over a decade after his sister's suicide, Bobby yet roams aimlessly, fatally stricken with grief for his

The scenes of Bobby out on the rig, apprehensively anticipating a lurking threat on the rig that never materializes.

It's also, I think, a sort of ode to dialogues the author enjoyed with physicists and academics during his years at SFI.
