__Ted Lasso__ has a lot of heart, but it's hardly believable.
Not because its story is far-fetched but because it doesn't _feel_ real.
When you're watching the show, you feel these are actors acting on a set.

Comparing __Ted Lasso__ to __Welcome to Wrexham__ might seem like cheating because one is fiction and the other is a documentary.
And, yes, that's part of it.
The soccer players are real professionals playing actual soccer and winning actual games.
But documentaries are not real life.
Documentaries are what you get when you mine life for its narrative nuggets and transform them into a story.

__Welcome to Wrexham__ does this well.
It recognizes that its main story -- whether Wrexham AFC will win promotion into league football -- is made up of little stories and is itself only a part of grander ones.
Some of the best episodes, like "The Quiet Zone" (S2E2), which explores the experience of people with autism, are only tangentially related to Wrexham's football team.
In the episode, Paul Mullin, Wrexham's star, opens up about his young son Albi's autism diagnosis and we meet Millie, a local who is very sensitive to noise because of her autism but attends Wrexham games religiously, always wearing sound-muffling headphones and one of her red Wrexham jerseys.
