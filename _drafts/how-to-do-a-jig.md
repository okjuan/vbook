how to do a jig

Some people like rigidity and predictability.
I prefer flexibility and possibility.

Some people prefer a predefined framework, whereas people like me prefer moodbased spontaneity.

Perhaps these are all methods for managing motivation.
Motivation for some people arises from a plan or a schedule.
For me motivation is an impulsive, mercurial thing.
Sometimes I ride a long wave of motivated work, at other times I float around aimlessly.
I struggle to do something because It Is Time To Do It.
I squirm under imperatives and wriggle out of them if I can instead to dedicate myself to irrelevant things that garner my interest.
I often find myself dedicating time to the wrong things instead of doing the things I'm supposed to do.
This includes my job.
From home I work a job that offers a steady supply of interesting work with scant restrictions regarding when and with whom I need to work.
I can easily procrastinate.
This makes for a comfortable life, in a way, but it also gets uncomfortable.
If I procastinate too much, I start feeling shitty about producing little, and often the bad feelings make it harder to get to work.
This has been a theme of my life for a long time.
I've written before about being frozen with inaction due to a lack of external forces to lurch me into activity.
For a long time as well I have fantasized about overcoming this recurring arrest by laying out a comprehensive plan, but that never works.
It's too ambitious and demanding.
It creates too much opportunity for failure.
By nature it creates a very narrow opportunity for success: by executing every part of the plan as prescribed.
The feeling of failure only makes me feel worse and again I retreat into avoidance, procrastination, and distraction.
In practice what has helped most to break me out of my invisible bind is _doing something_.
That's the goal.
Just _do something_.
So broad is the goal that there are myriad ways to achieve it.
It doesn't matter if what I should be doing is working or doing paperwork or planning for an upcoming trip.
If I make my bed, empty the dishwasher, read my book, write my thoughts, draw a picture, call my mom, whatever – I've succeeded.
Then, the feeling of minor success and the enlivening sensation of _acting_ kickstarts the engine.

This problem of getting unstuck and moving again is one I face over and over in my life.
If I'm lucky, I get into a rhythm that last multiple days.
Each action propels the next.
The running engine charges the battery, and when I inevitably lose some momentum, it's not so hard to get started again.

Every day, we take our dog out to do his business.
It's a strange ritual.
He, like us, likes to sleep in and start the day slowly.
When we let him out of his cage in the morning – _Release the Kraken_, we say – he scurries to our bed, sneezing with delight all the way.

My wife and I don't get up at the same time every day, but the first thing we normally do is let our little dog out of his cage – _Release the Kraken_, we say.
It's a cute little ritual.
As soon as one of us approaches his little gate, he cannot contain his thrill.
He starts bouncing, pushing himself up rhythmically with his front two paws.
His "push ups," as our former roommate calls it.
Upon release from his bed he scurries to ours, sneezing with delight as he goes.
There he joins the other one of us who hasn't risen yet, greets us enthusiastically and promptly burrows under the duvet and nestles between our legs or in the crook behind them.
Every day it's the same and every day it's a delightful moment.

We leave him there in bed to enjoy his morning nap.
