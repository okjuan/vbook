That tens of millions of Americans voted for Trump should not just concern us.
It should also interest us.

### story 1: Pray Without Ceasing

Out of the five, this one is most complex in technique.
There are two stories: the primary one, which happened decades earlier, and a secondary one, which is unfolding in the present.
    In the present, the main character..
    The main story is told to the main character by his grandmother
    The main story is about the main character's grandfather grandmother
    Berry frames the main story
TODO: explain

The complicated structure is not just for show.
It's constructed so that it will click into place at the story's climax.
We learn that the main character lives because of the forgiveness his forefathers bore.

This is a deliberate choice.
The story doesn't climax with the murder or the subsequent suicide.
A writer must assemble their pieces so that the jewel is centermost.

The killer fails to trust in his community and, in a rage, stretches it to its limits, threatening to tear it apart.
But it stays integral.
Through forgiveness, the community survives.
Those of us lucky to live in community ought to know that it is a foundation built from labor and love.

### story 2: A Jonquil for Mary Penn

A great example of expressionism: external representation of internal state.
And a great example of imbuing the setting with the meaning of the story in a way that doesn't need to be _thought_, doesn't require decoding, but is instead _felt_.

### story 3: Making It Home

Art Rowanberry's tendency "[not to use a machine to do something that he could do himself]" echoes Berry's controversial declaration that he would never use a computer.

The moment most imprinted in my mind is when Art stops to wash and shave at the creek.
The quiet of the woods,
    the coldness of the water on the skin,
    the feeling of self-sufficiency at improvising a solution,
    the love expressed in marching home,
    the pride of returning home clean and shaven.
