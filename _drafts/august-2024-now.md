Getting injured, traveling, and more.

### getting injured

I've been getting a bit unlucky.
My first attempt at returning to soccer goalkeeping resulted in a badly sprained ring finger.
The xray showed "a couple tiny fragments of bone", which the hand doctor that I was later referred to desribed as "technically a break".
To him, I relayed the playful question my friend has asked: what happens to the bits of bone?
Yes, he confirmed, they get "resorbed".
(I'd used the word humorously, but it turned out to be a real word.)

A few weeks later, back in the outfield, my domain, I took a meanly struck soccer ball to the back of the head.
In my couple decades of playing soccer, I've headed many, many balls deliberately and even taken several to the face.
But I can't recall ever getting hit so firmly on the back of the head, or it ever hurting so much.

Immediately, I subbed off to rest my sore head, unconcerned and expecting to resume playing as if nothing had happened.
But I noticed my mind working differently.
The ongoing match had a dreamy quality.
A slow stream of associative memories bubbled into my conscious mind.
Times I'd played soccer before, vague recollections of past situations on the field without any obvious relevance.
(I later related the incident to some friends and one of them told me he'd once fallen on a turf field and experienced deja vu the instant his head struck the ground.)
I found the symptomps amusing, not particularly worrisome.
The knock to the head had clearly thrust me into a creative state of mind.
(I would confirm this interpretation the next day by scoring 0:27 and 0:36 on the New York Times Mini Crossword, an order of magnitude smaller than my usual times.)

I kept playing.
The dreamlike quality persisted.
It was golden hour, and the air glowed with sunshine like in the cottage scene of Mulholland Drive.
Dazed, but still unfazed, I told my teammates at half time.
In the second half of the game, they started noticing something was off with me.
Instead of taking a throw-in, I kicked it in.
Woahhhh, they called in unison, it's throw-ins!
I laughed and brushed it off, I'd played a game a few days prior where we did kick-ins.
In hindsight I realize this was not a normal mistake to make.
I'd been playing in that league for months and had witnessed several throw-ins already in that very match.

By the end of the game, I'd figured I shouldn't drive myself home.
A couple teammates drove me closer to home.
My wife Z would come halfway and pick me up.
While we waited for Z, we stood outside, chatting.
One of my teammates interrupted me midsentence to point out the strange, yogalike position I had assumed mindlessly.
I was balancing on one leg, the other one drawn up and bent so that the sole of the foot was pressed against the inside of my standing leg.
My left arm was arched upwards and in that hand I held an empty bottle of sportsdrink, which I was balancing on the top of my head.

Z arrived and we deliberated about going to the doctor.
I called the nurse hotline that I get through my work's medical insurance and, to my surprise, after I answered in the negative to most questions, the nurse advised, in a very placid, almost bored tone, that I seek urgent medical care.
So we went to a practically empty urgent care clinic nearby only to be turned away because they were closing in less than thirty minutes.
We got back in the car and I called the nurse hotline again, to get a second opinion.
But again, we were advised, in detached monotone, to go to the emergency room.
More than concerned, I felt annoyed.
Surely I was fine.
Surely in caveman days I would've simply retreated to my shelter to rest.

So I went to the emergency room.
This time the cold voice had a blank stare, and it informed me I would need to pay a thousand dollars just to get seen by a doctor.
Sheesh.
I prodded for some advice, hoping to be assured that my symptoms didn't sound too bad.
She shrugged expressionlessly.
I sat there, visibly mulling.
Could someone give me a quick opinon?
She looked at the nurse next to her, who then looked at me and asked me tersely, Any slurred speech, vomitting?
None.
She shrugged.
I left, smiling sardonically.

Back in the car with Z, I told her how much it would cost and that I didn't think it was serious enough warrant it.
She was inclined to agree with me, but very wary of being negligent.
So we called a third nurse, this time the public one in British Columbia.
This one was bubbly and warm.
She went through a checklist similar to the one that the other two nurses had followed, but seemed happier to listen to answers longer than yes or no.
I answered the same questions again patiently, encouraged by the expectation that this nurse, finally, would tell me that it was probably fine to go home tonight and, if need be, see a doctor tomorrow.
