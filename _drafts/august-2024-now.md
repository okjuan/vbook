### getting injured

I've been getting a bit unlucky.
My first attempt at returning to goalkeeping resulted in a badly sprained ring finger.
The xray showed "a couple tiny fragments of bone", which the hand doctor that I was later referred to desribed as "technically a break", but really just a sprain.
To him, I relayed the playful question my friend has asked: what happens to the bits of bone?
Yes, he confirmed, they get "resorbed".
I had used the word humorously, but, it turns out, it's a real word.

Less than a month later, back in the outfield, my domain, I took a meanly struck soccer ball to the back of the head.
In my time, I've headed many, many balls willingly, some of which hurt when I misjudged them and they hit the top of my head, and I've taken several, against my will, to the face.
But I can't recall ever getting hit so firmly on the back of the head, or it ever hurting so much.

Immediately, I subbed off to rest my sore head, unconcerned and expecting to resume playing as if nothing had happened.
But I noticed my mind working differently.
A slow stream of associative memories bobbled into my conscious mind.
Times I'd played soccer before, vague recollections of past situations on the field.
I was amused.
The knock to the head had clearly thrust me into a creative state of mind.
(I would confirm this interpretation the next day, by scoring 0:27 and 0:36 in the New York Times Mini Crossword.)

### what's next?

Enjoying the rare and splendid sunny days of PNW summer.
Biking, paddleboarding, playing soccer, volleyball with friends.

I'm curious about playing goalkeeper for a new team.
I've been an outfield player exclusively for years, but I used to play goalie part-time and fill in when needed.
I miss it a bit.
And goalies are always in demand, so it should be an easy way to get more playing time.
Hopefully I'm not overestimating my skills in net.
I think I'll find out soon.

Cap Hill Block Party.
Excited about seeing Chappell Roan, who is apparently great to see live.

Visit PEI, before Z's mom and stepdad sell the house they have on the beach there.
