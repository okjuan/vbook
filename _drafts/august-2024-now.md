Getting injured, traveling, and more.

### getting injured

I've been getting a bit unlucky.
My first attempt at returning to soccer goalkeeping resulted in a badly sprained ring finger.
The xray showed "a couple tiny fragments of bone", which the hand doctor that I was later referred to desribed as "technically a break".
To him, I relayed the playful question my friend has asked: what happens to the bits of bone?
Yes, he confirmed, they get "resorbed".
(I'd used the word humorously, but it turned out to be a real word.)

A few weeks later, back in the outfield, my domain, I took a meanly struck soccer ball to the back of the head.
In my couple decades of playing soccer, I've headed many, many balls deliberately and even taken several to the face.
But I can't recall ever getting hit so firmly on the back of the head, or it ever hurting so much.

Immediately, I subbed off to rest my sore head, unconcerned and expecting to resume playing as if nothing had happened.
But I noticed my mind working differently.
The ongoing match had a dreamy quality.
A slow stream of associative memories bubbled into my conscious mind.
Times I'd played soccer before, vague recollections of past situations on the field without any obvious relevance.
(I later related the incident to some friends and one of them told me he'd once fallen on a turf field and experienced deja vu the instant his head struck the ground.)
I found the symptomps amusing, not particularly worrisome.
The knock to the head had clearly thrust me into a creative state of mind.
(I would confirm this interpretation the next day by scoring 0:27 and 0:36 on the New York Times Mini Crossword, an order of magnitude smaller than my usual times.)

I kept playing.
The dreamlike quality persisted.
It was golden hour, and the air glowed with sunshine like in the cottage scene of Mulholland Drive.
Dazed, but still unfazed, I told my teammates at half time.
In the second half of the game, they started noticing something was off with me.
Instead of taking a throw-in, I kicked it in.
Woahhhh, they called in unison, it's throw-ins!
I laughed and brushed it off, I'd played a game a few days prior where we did kick-ins.
In hindsight I realize this was not a normal mistake to make.
I'd been playing in that league for months and had witnessed several throw-ins already in that very match.

By the end of the game, I'd figured I shouldn't drive myself home.
A couple teammates drove me closer to home.
My wife Z would come halfway and pick me up.
While we waited for Z, we stood outside, chatting.
One of my teammates interrupted me midsentence to point out the strange, yogalike position I had assumed mindlessly.
I was balancing on one leg, the other one drawn up and bent so that the sole of the foot was pressed against the inside of my standing leg.
My left arm was arched upwards and in that hand I held an empty bottle of sportsdrink, which I was balancing on the top of my head.
