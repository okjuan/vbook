### getting injured

I've been getting a bit unlucky.
My first attempt at returning to soccer goalkeeping resulted in a badly sprained ring finger.
The xray showed "a couple tiny fragments of bone", which the hand doctor that I was later referred to desribed as "technically a break".
To him, I relayed the playful question my friend has asked: what happens to the bits of bone?
Yes, he confirmed, they get "resorbed".
(I'd used the word humorously, but it turned out to be a real word.)

A few weeks later, back in the outfield, my domain, I took a meanly struck soccer ball to the back of the head.
In my couple decades of playing soccer, I've headed many, many balls deliberately and even taken several to the face.
But I can't recall ever getting hit so firmly on the back of the head, or it ever hurting so much.

Immediately, I subbed off to rest my sore head, unconcerned and expecting to resume playing as if nothing had happened.
But I noticed my mind working differently.
The ongoing match had a dreamy quality.
A slow stream of associative memories bubbled into my conscious mind.
Times I'd played soccer before, vague recollections of past situations on the field without any obvious relevance.
(I later related the incident to some friends and one of them told me he'd once fallen on a turf field and experienced deja vu the instant his head struck the ground.)
I found the symptomps amusing, not particularly worrisome.
The knock to the head had clearly thrust me into a creative state of mind.
(I would confirm this interpretation the next day by scoring 0:27 and 0:36 on the New York Times Mini Crossword, an order of magnitude smaller than my usual times.)
