# watching Movies

I've also watched several movies.

__Godland__: striking, beautiful imagery and a sickening protagonist.

__The Substance__: impactful, entertaining, and memorable, but underdeveloped in its writing.

__Woman of the Hour__: a graceful directorial debut from Anna Kendrick. Stylish, thoughtful, and restrained.

__We Live In Time__: touching emotionally and palatable aesthetically, but surprisingly clich√© and underwhelming in substance.

__Anora__: fun watch, but it underdelivered on substance and character development.
