I've been interested in psychoanalysis since at least 2014, when I read about Freud's concept of [sublimation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sublimation_(psychology)).
Despite the distrust most folks today have for psychoanalysis, I trust it has insights.
I also find ridiculous Freud's insistence that the Oedipus Complex is not only a universal childhood trauma but _the_ central childhood trauma.
But I'm more interested in _descriptive_ theories rather than _prescriptive_ ones.
I am skeptical of being given a blueprint

I'm less interested in elaborate psychological theories that peel off from the concrete into their own world.
I don't want a prescriptive blueprint,
A model sketched separately and then overlayed on top.
I appreciate these as _evaluative_ frameworks but distrust them as _normative_ frameworks, as they seem often to be treated.
TODO: reference `how to understand the world`
It is a model to help us organize reality into sensible components,
but it doesn't mean that reality _consists_ of these components,
in the same way that tinted lenses do not reveal hidden colors in the world.

If we want to make claims about reality
We have to humble our ambitions.
How likely are we to decode the full system of reality into a model?
We aren't!
We should content ourselves with deducing patterns and sub-systems,
repeating tendencies and dynamics.

Stephen Shapiro blew my mind when he wrote -- in his book _Trusting Yourself: Psychotherapy as a Beginning_ -- that people who are chronically late might be surprised to discover an unconscious resistance to external control.
I stay up at night and never keep to a disciplined sleeping schedule -- is that an articulation of my resent for external discipline?
I have spite for rigidity, especially when it appears arbitrary or unnecessary.
There are two fascinating things about this tendency of mine:
1. It is steadfast and unconscious.
2. It recognizes instances of discipline eagerly, or even contrues them from things that are not.

This implies an unconscious belief system that understands concepts such as discipline and resistance,
and motivates a certain meaningful behavior in response:
A private algebra, calculated unconsciously, that assigns value to actions and reactions.
Something like Lacan's ideas about Symbolism, Imagination, and the claim that "the unconscious is structured like a language".
And, while I am hesitant to absorb this claim as fact, I gratefully accept this pattern as a type of behavior I can expect my unconscious self to partake in.

In a way, this is confusion.
Not random confusion, where understanding is wrong because it's based on noisy information,
but a structured confusion, where understanding misapplies some sensible rules, or miscalculates in some other step of the process.

Perhaps fear is good example of structured confusion.
You might have little or no reason to fear something will happen, but you fear it nonetheless.
When presented with solid, helpful arguments explaining why there is no need to fear, fear can continue unsoothed.

A friend of mine was the victim of a random stabbing.
He was waiting at a crosswalk, in broad daylight, in the boringly safe neighborhood near his suburban work campus.
The attacker was a fellow employee.
The two had never met or talked.
My friend survived a dozen stab wounds with minimal lasting damage.

A few months later, I was stupid enough to play a trailer for a violent movie when he was in the room.
As soon as he saw a thug pull a knife on the screen, he left the room, triggered.

Everyone knows there is no danger.
And yet everyone knows that this would be extremely upsetting for him.

Sensorally and symbolically, what was shown in the trailer is meaningfully connected to what he experienced.
Our body and mind rely on these meanings.
In a way, our reality is more these meanings than it is reality itself.
When we look at a loved one, we don't see a cluster of atoms or cells, or a shape of colors and textures, we see a meaning.
We see security, we see love, we see trust.
We feel safe, we feel worthy.
We see something that imposes on our time and will.
We feel claustrophobic, we feel controlled, we feel trapped.

Objective reality is reliably translated in subjective reality.

Yet we think that, above all, we are observing things as they are.
Is this not a fundamental structured confusion?

How many of your experiences do you trust?

The structured confusion is layered beyond this fundamental layer.
Even if you are aware of your subjectivity, how much of its logic is hidden in your subsconscious?

When you see something or someone beautiful and you feel what you feel,
how do you know this is not a confused response in itself?
Are you sure you're simply enjoying beauty because humans have evolved to enjoy it?
The obvious layer of confusion here is addressed with the question: _why_ do you like beauty?
What about it should induce pleasure in you and what actions should it invite?

The subtler layer is: how do you know that your interaction with beauty is not a confused reaction like the one you have to being on time?
There is hidden meaning to your tardiness.
What is the hidden meaning to your lust? to your love of art? of nature?
Are you so sure it is wholly of first order?
Or have these natural behaviors been hijacked by unconscious, frustrated impulses with other original agendas?
The agenda, for example, of establishing your self-worth?
