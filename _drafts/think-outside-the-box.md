I often apply my logic in broad sweeps, eager to work through to a solution as quickly as possible.
Problems are often inconveniences that demand my attention against my will.
I was hoping to relax and read, but now I have to knead out a logistical pain in the neck.
But when you work quickly, you don't think to shift assumptions that seem immutable.
You see the obvious options, but you don't see their hybrids, the combinations that compose new solutions.

One of my favorite stories of out-of-the-box thinking is from AirBnB's early days.
Frustrated and $40K in debt, the co-founders paused their entrepreneurial efforts to do something fun and unrelated to their startup.
So they designed cereal boxes themed for the 2008 presidential campaign -- Obama O's and Cap'n McCain's.
They marketed them as collector's items and sold them for $40 apiece, recuperating $30K as well as the enthusiasm to get to work.
