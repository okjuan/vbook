I like reading memoirs.
They show me how lives can be lived.
Blogs offer something similar.
Normally less artfully written, but more current, and relatable, especially when written by another software engineer.

I had the idea to put up a website when I was reading a bunch of other blogs.
Derek Sivers' blog in particular made me want to create my own blog.
(I'm still hoping to come up with a URL as clean as [https://sive.rs/](https://sive.rs/).)
I've always been like that.
If I see someone doing something I think is cool, I want to do it, too.

The first thing I thought to post was my resume.
Where I've worked, projects I've worked on, and so on.
Also, a Now page, like [https://sive.rs/now](https://sive.rs/now).
I typed it up and admired the list of things I've done and am doing.

Then I put up a page reviewing my 2022, like [Greg Schier's](https://schier.co/blog/2022-review).
I've been journaling on and off for years now, and my favorite thing to journal is a year in review.
I look back at the year at what I did, what happened to me, and what I accomplished.
I like to stay aware of what has been happening in my life because I don't ever want to look back and think -- where has the time gone?
Being mindful of what I do with my time is important to me.

I wasn't satisfied with my new website, though.
So far, I was just broadcasting biographical information.
Things too personal to garner an audience.
My goal is not to become blog famous, but if I'm going to write in public, I might as well write something worth reading.

Then, I had a good idea.
The site would be called "How to" and consist of posts titled "How to X."

I'd been watching the HBO show "How to with John Wilson"
Episodes are titled things like "How to make small talk" and "How to remember your dreams", but they consist more of John Wilson's musings and confessions than tips or guides.

The "how to" is just a rhetorical device.
An invitation to think about a subject and let your mind wander

It occurred to me that I could borrow the rhetorical

Then, a good idea came to me.
When I was showering, I think.
The site would be called "How to" and would consist of posts titled "How to X."
