One should write sparely, with non-essential words pruned and scraped off.

Why though?

It's not just about saving the reader's time.
It's to create a certain aesthetic experience.

Words standing by themselves look and feel different.
They _mean_ different, perhaps?
They mean more by having to shoulder more meaning in the sentence
When you don't need words grouping together to hold a concept up,
when you let a single word alone do it,
when you find a word that can do it,
there is more cohesiveness, more focus, more clarity in the meaning being conveyed.
in the same way that a single visionary can produce what a committee cannot
