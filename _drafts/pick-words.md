Words sit somewhere on the spectrum between concrete and conceptual.

"draining" v.s. "taxing"
The word "drain" matches a physical experience but the word "tax" matches a concept. So long as synonyms exist I can choose words that reflect/mirror/copy/mimic/emulate sensory experience to cause/provoke/elicit/evoke.

When the reader reads "draining" they hear the gurgle of the bathroom sink. But when they read "taxing", what do they see?

"imbue" v.s. "mark"
To me, imbue feels nice. The sound of the word is gentle and quite pretty. I also respect it for achieving something -- to imbue is to change something without destroying it, and to do so without force. To inject substance into substance, changing its course without stopping its momentum.

To mark something is to strike down on it. To intervene, to interrupt. To change something whether or not it wishes to change. The advantage of the word, though, is its physicality. It's vivid. It's not as abstract.

When you write, you choose between a fancier, less accessible option and an earthy, real one.
