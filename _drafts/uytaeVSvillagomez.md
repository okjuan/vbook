Lately I've been watching recordings of public hearings for rezoning applications presented to the Vancouver City Council.
The City of Vancouver [streams them on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@VanCityClerk/streams).
Here are {% vbook_post some things I've observed | 2025-07-11-notes-on-vancouver-rezoning-hearings %}.

This was a long time coming before it precipitated suddenly.
While browsing the internet for pages like {% vbook_post mine | 2025-06-05-whose-city %} about the "pop-up plaza" @ Kitchener Street and Commercial Drive, I chanced upon the site [spacing.ca](https://spacing.ca/).
I left the tab open for a few days until I figured I'd quickly peruse the site and then close it.
That's when I noticed an article with a rather grave title: [_The Trifecta of Control: Stealth. Speed. Complexity._](https://spacing.ca/vancouver/2025/06/16/the-trifecta-of-control-stealth-speed-complexity/) by Erick Villagomez, a part-time lecturer at UBC's School of Community and Regional Planning.
It sounded like something that might appear in a textbook about fascism, not in an article about the Vancouver City Council.

The alarmist tone of the title persisted throughout the article.
The writer railed against the recently-passed [Development Approval Procedure (DAP) Bylaw](https://council.vancouver.ca/20250603/documents/r2.pdf) as calculated, antidemocratic legislation.
At intervals throughout the article, the writer reprised his catchphrase – _speed, stealth, complexity_ – to describe a three-pronged tactic that the city council was supposedly employing to rob Vancouver of its "democratic soul."
If the city was indeed being run by a ring of underhanded authoritarians orchestrating the city's descent to fascist rule, this was the first I'd heard of it.

What did the bylaw actually do?
It narrowed the scope of rezoning proposals for which public hearings would be required.
That's it.
The bylaw was not stoppering all channels for public feedback.
In any case, a public hearing is not a referendum.
The decision is made by mayor and councillors, each of whom gets one vote and are themselves elected by the citizens of Vancouver.
Was the author suggesting this was the start of an antidemocratic backslide?
It's hard not to suspect him of fear mongering.
We are, after all, in Canada, and he and all his readers will be aware of the legitimate threat of fascism rising elsewhere in the world.
Are we to suppose the danger has infiltrated the lawmaking process of Vancouver?

The article does not try to engage with any reasoning that might justify fewer public hearings.
One such argument is offered by Uytae Lee in a video that he dedicated wholly to this topic and posted on his YouTube channel _About Here_.
According to Uytae, public hearings represent poorly the opinions and interests of the general public.
It is a small subsection of civilians who have the means – time, energy, awareness, and ability to attend or call in – to participate in hearings.
And the greatest incentive to participate is for those who _oppose_ a rezoning proposal.

Uytae illustrates these points with an example in which a rezoning proposal to allow the construction of a child care facility on a residential street was met with vehement resistance by certain members of the public.
They complained on various points – it would add competition for street parking, it would clash with the character of the neighborhood, and so on.
And, indeed, these are potential drawbacks.
But all things have positive consequences and negative ones.
Pros and cons are inescapable.
Talking about the cons does not constitute a good argument.
How often is it that the cons are so bad, so _horrid_, that the pros deserve no consideration?

While reading the _Trifecta of Control_ article, I kept wondering what the author would think of Uytae's argument against the efficacy of public hearings.
That when I found another one of his articles: [_Et Tu, Uytae?_]().
Woah.
Uytae, the traitor, the backstabber, slayer of righteousness.
If nothing else, this man had half an ear for snappy witticisms.

But what I found in this article was more of the same.
More stirring of moral panic, more rhetoric than argument.
The author pointed to Uytae's lack of credentials in the domain of urban planning and decried his intentions as compromised by corporate interest.
He warned of the shallowness of social media and their propensity to create "echo chambers."

At this point, I worried.
Had I been gullible?
Had I trusted Uytae's content too much?
Perhaps while watching Uytae's videos I'd misinterpreted the pleasant feeling of being entertained with the feeling of understanding, when in fact I was taking in corporate propaganda colored to appear like insight offered by an independent?

It was plausible.
But the author still hadn't offered any evidence of misdeed on Uytae's part.
He was not forthcoming about that.
I scrolled down until I found a specific reference to Uytae's videos.
It named the video _The Problem with "Luxury Housing"_ and criticized Uytae for leaving out the fact that new towers often displaced current residents.

So I rewatched Uytae's video.
In it, Uytae engages with the "luxury housing" epithet often lobbed in opposition to the construction of new residential towers.
He countered with his own argument and gave evidence to support it.
This was a typical Uytae video – a single, cogent point illustrated with an example.
Returning to _Et Tu, Uytae?_, I was baffled.
He did not engage at all with Uytae's point.
After assembling the structure of a general purpose argument against social media, he left it all but unfurnished with anything regarding Uytae's content.
He just named some vague, negative effect of towers in response to Uytae's criticism of the "luxury housing" tag often slapped on towers.

This was, finally, how I came to watching a public hearing.
The example Uytae gave in his video was of the controversial "Safeway Towers," the proposal to build three ~40-storey towers next to the Commercial-Broadway skytrain station.
When I searched online, I found that the proposal had passed a few weeks prior.
