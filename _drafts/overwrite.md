Transcript from the scene where AJ and Tess are trapped in the dungeon, under the grate.

> This is very, very important.
> You need to stay calm.
> You cannot freak out around her, ok? Trust me!

> I don't wanna be here.

> Do you think I wanna fucking be here?
> Ok -- you cannot get upset. If you get upset, she gets upset.

> She? Who's she?

> Drink it. Just fucking drink it.

The writing here is good.
A) Without telling us explicitly, it answers our question about what happened to Tess.
B) It answers our question about what happened to Tess without telling it explicitly.
It shows us how she's been surviving.
It catches us up on the story without stopping it.

It shows us how she has managed to survive: she learned the rules, the ones she's giving AJ now.

> What the fuck?

> Do it. Drink it. Just do it, drink it! Get up!
> Don't you see? She just wants you to be her baby.

One of the boldest stylistic choices of this movie is the transition from our first encounter with the monster Keith's mauling

A) At first we figure this violent, roaring giant-woman, thundering up and down her cave, is the Barbarian.
B) At first we figure the Barbarian is this violent, roaring giant-woman thundering up and down her cave.
Later we learn she's as caring as any mother, startingly human despite being a product of pure brutalization.
She's the victim of a murderous, violating monster -- the real Barbarian.

This parallels AJ's rape accusation story.
Often the assault victim is blamed as the cruel bitch ruining a man's reputation.
