They inflate property value.
They block views.
They cast shadows.
They are a bad fit for the neighborhood character.
They belong downtown.

The highest ideal held by this group – the ideal they don't just claim, but actually try to effect – is conservatism.
That is, the maintaining of things as they are.
It's a rather convenient value to have for those who most benefit from the status quo.
For them, change appears a vile beast.
Let them rage, rage against the dying of the light.
