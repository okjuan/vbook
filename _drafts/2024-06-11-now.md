New York, Tofino, patio furniture, reading, writing.

<!--more-->

### Life

Among the best purchases and finest decisions I've made recently is our new patio furniture.
I bought it secondhand for $420 USD ($575 CAD), delivery included, and within a week have spent many more minutes (in either currency) lounging, reading, writing, and working on it.
It was something I had in the back of my mind for a few months until it sprung to the top after spending a few glorious hours in cushy seating on the sunny balcony of our Tofino airnbnb.
I prowled Facebook Marketplace for several days until I pulled the trigger on this set, spending more on it than I was hoping to, but ending up much satisfied.
It has added a whole new space to our one bedroom apartment, and I expect to recoup a good deal of the principal when we sell it in a year or two.

An odd perk of splitting my time between Seattle and Vancouver has been furnishing and decorating a second apartment, a task for which I have enough gusto to do more than twice over.
I mentioned to one friend that I would love to help them design their space if they would humor me.
I told another friend, who finds furnish and decorating stultifying, that when he buys his house, I will invite myself over and personally hang the artwork and mirror that have been leaning against his apartment walls for years.
I'm even toying with the idea of making TikToks or Instagram reels about my amateur interest in interior design.
I already have the topic for the initial video: how to get cheap artwork that you love.

Hoping to start losing weight again this summer.

### Travel

Z and I went to Tofino with my family for a week to celebrate my mom's birthday.
We spent time together, ate great meals, surfed on beautiful beaches, hung out at a wonderful airbnb near the heart of town, spent a day in an [outdoor spa in a private cove](https://www.moonjellyspa.ca/) bathing in hot tubs filled with seaweed, and even [saw the Northern Lights](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/May_2024_solar_storms).
Z and I want to go back.

A week later, Z and I went to {% post_url_with_hover_card NYC | 2024-05-26-nyc-trip %} to affirm our suspicion that we would like to live there before we have kids.
In the month leading up to the trip, I dedicated some good hours to researching and planning, and they were well worth it.
That time rendered some of the most memorable experiences of the trip: Comedy Cellar, Village Vanguard, {% post_url_with_hover_card Blue Note | 2024-06-04-blue-note %}, Whitney Museum (for free), Tiny Cupboard Comedy Club, Roberta's, and SEY coffee.
Some of these I booked in advance, but others I was aware of and pounced on when the opportunity arose.
Another highlight was the ferry from Astoria to Wall St, which was recommended by a friend of a friend.

### Work

I've delivered some good results at work recently.
My tasks continue to be interesting and plenty.
However, it looks like my next promotion, which I was expecting in September, won't happen until December.
I'm disappointed, but when I reflect on it carefully, I notice it's not that important.
By no means do I _need_ to be promoted.
It's alluring because it's a quantifiable, salient achievement, but it's not important.

### Coding

None.
Again, Spotify rejected my request for an extended quota.
I emailed them back asking to speak to a real person.
No response.
It looks like it's going to be difficult to make [my app](https://okjuan.me/muze-radio/) available to all Spotify premium users, unfortunately.
That project is going to sit on the backburner for a while.

As for my other recent programming project -- this site -- I have some interesting new ideas.
To encourage myself to {% post_url_with_hover_card revise and rework posted pieces | 2024-04-25-what-2 %}, I want to re-order posts by their most recently edited date rather than their original publish date.
That way, I could breathe new life into old ideas that I failed to do justice on initial attempt and baptize them again as new pieces.
This aligns with the **dynamic** aspect of my {% post_url_with_hover_card virtual book | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %} idea.
A related idea I have for this site is to let (hypothetical) readers see past versions of each post, in the spirit of what I wrote in my essay {% post_url_with_hover_card The Virtual Book | 2023-08-11-virtual-book %} last year:

> What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
> ...
> What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
> What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?

One of my core interests, and one of the core passions behind this site, is the process of writing.
Interfaces that illuminate and accentuate that process intrigue me.

I stayed up all night to watch them at 4am.
Slept at 6:30am, woke in the afternoon.

reading: jan morris, bell hooks, jane jacobs, gloria steinem.
audiobooks: Rest, which was underwhelming but thought-provoking, e.g. regarding the Default Mode Network
audiobooks: Debt, the first 5,000 years. David Graeber seems like one of the most interesting intellectuals of recent time.
