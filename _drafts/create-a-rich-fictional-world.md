The writing in The Sopranos is simple in its approach, yet it produces a rich, dynamic world.
In each season they set up tensions and then resolve them.
I think there is normally one main tension per season.
In season 1, its Tony v Uncle Junior.
But there is also Tony v his mom, Liv.
One of the ways they achieve the complexity of their world is coordinating different tensions.
In season 1, Liv's vitriolic attitude towards her son poisons Uncle Junior's ear against Tony, leading to Uncle Junior calling a hit on Tony.
In season 2, a couple of naive and ambitious brutes (tension 2) piggyback on Richie Aprille's cold war with Tony (tension 1) with the attempted murder of Christopher.

The reason these tensions are so compelling

These tensions drive the plots to climax at the end of the season
The reason these high points are so compelling and thrilling is that the characters are so believable

Also, the co-development of various tensions allow the writers to create various spikes of excitement around the climax -- the biggest spike.

They mentally lob something in the air and try to faithfully render its arc to its resolution.
