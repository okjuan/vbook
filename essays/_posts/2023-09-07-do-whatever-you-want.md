A not-so-secret desire of mine is to write non-fiction professionally.

To dive into worlds for the sake of experiencing, observing, understanding, and then responding through art.

John McPhee, for example, has made a great career of writing about many less-than-scintillating topics, including the movement of coal across America, the shifting flow of the Mississippi River, and oranges.

But for now I'm content with working as a software engineer and writing on my own time.
It's the [perfect balance](https://sive.rs/balance).
