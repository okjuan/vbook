Ever since I read [How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1143788.How_to_Talk_About_Books_You_Haven_t_Read?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=dQGK5Adu5Y&rank=1), I've stopped trying to absorb everything I read.
I often [ditch a book](https://okjuan.medium.com/feeling-good-about-ditching-books-1c4633fd87f) without finishing it because I know I'm going to forget most of it anyway.
I also don't try to read for hours in a row unless I'm engrossed.
At a certain point, it just becomes information binging.
Better to chew on a good morsel, digest it, and move on.

I try to read things I can contemplate and experiment with, or things I can apply immediately.
I worry less about memorizing facts and instead try to encode the information into my behavior.
Pick up a new habit, try a new approach.
Months and years from now, I won't recall exactly what I took from a book, even if I'm still carrying it with me.

We want to absorb knowledge, to etch it into our brains.
We want a clear idea of what we're gaining because we're afraid it's nothing.
But there are good places to store knowledge outside the immediate reach of your conscious self.
Feed the ideas directly into your work now.
Why have knowledge unless you're using it?
If this knowledge lasts only for the period of its application, does that matter?
Do you need it if you're not going to apply it?
What's the point in building your potential if you're never going to convert it into action?
