I read with haste, crazed by [the amount of content]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-01-28-choose-your-next-book %}) I won't get to unless I hurry.
I try to process quickly, see the sense in what the author is saying, and continue to the next thing.
I bias towards agreement, and don't distinguish carefully between my confusion and my disagreement.

I want to practice something new.

I want to look carefully for the little mounds that form over an author's sentences, bits of hidden meaning.
Often the author overlooks or neglects or assumes their way around knotty bits that they don't want to untangle.
But real progress comes from working through these knots.
It's easy to sketch and outline, to present a model.
But it's hard to resolve the tensions that arise when working out the details.

It's hard to abide by the cliche of breadth and depth because they present different challenges.
It can be difficult to cross into new territories, to become a beginner again, to face again the vastness of your ignorance.
Difficult in a different way is staying put, digging, insisting on uncertain prize.
This second one feels hard to justify when on a [race against death]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2023-01-28-prepare-for-death %}).
It's slow, very slow, unpromising, unencouraging.
But it's the only way to get to things below the surface.
