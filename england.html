<div class="paragraph"><p>Before we settled on Bristol, Z and I considered visiting Liverpool.
When I noticed that Wrexham was nearby, I fancied a day trip down to see them play their first ever(?) Championship match at the Racecourse, or at least to grab a pint at The Turf and meet Wayne, the charming bar owner and Wrexham A.F.C. devotee.
I just realized he reminds me of Karl Pilkington.
Agh, I’m almost regretting not pursuing this plan.
Commute from Bristol to Wrexham would be long and I can’t imagine tickets would be cheap to get, if any were available at all.
I suppose it might still be worth it if I can watch the game at The Turf.
We’ll see.
Z won’t be thrilled with the idea, but the 16th is my birthday and for it she’ll do whatever possible to make me happy.
I’m a lucky guy.</p></div>

</li>
  <li>read about Marshall McLuhan, the New Criticism, Harold Innis</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The late afternoon flight gave me lots of time to get the apartment in order before leaving.
I watered my plants and gathered them all into the office for Z’s mom to water while we’re away.
Baxter is staying with my mom in Victoria.
I expect he’ll bond with her and my younger sister in the three weeks he stays with them as he did with our friends who dogsat him while Z and I were in Indonesia in 2023.
In particular he loves our friend A, who playfought with him.
He loves to playfight.</p></div>

<h4 id="friday-08082025--dublin">Friday 08/08/2025 – Dublin</h4>

<ul>
  <li>arrive at Dublin Airport in the morning; take cab to Airbnb, drop off luggage</li>

  <li>eat lunch @ SPACE JARU, then browse @ Marrowbone Books &amp; chat with the worker about authors</li>

  <li>visit National Gallery of Ireland; dinner @ All Bar Chicken; walk back to Airbnb to shower and unwind</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The locals have been very friendly and helpful.
The cabbie chatted with us cheerfully.
Z anticipates being upstaged in the realm of enthusiastic socializing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It surprised me how small the city feels.
The weather is gray and mild and windy, good for walking outdoors.
There is a good deal of car traffic.
Many if not most buildings are made of brick and sit at two or three stories.</p></div>

<h4 id="saturday-08092025--dublin">Saturday 08/09/2025 – Dublin</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee @ The Little Cactus</li>

  <li>attend stand up comedy @ In Stitches Comedy</li>
  <li>get takeout pizza &amp; fries from Manor Takeaway Foods</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I like it here.
There is an abundance of pubs, quality coffee shops, public transit, bike lanes, leftists, and young people.
Z says it reminds her of Vancouver.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Dublin feels bigger today.
It’s the weekend and this afternoon there was a friendly game between Leeds United and AC Milan so the streets are chock full of people, many in yellow and white Leeds jerseys and a few Rossoneri sprinkled about.
The city center is swarming with pedestrians, pubs brimming with cheerful drinkers pooling on the sidewalks by the entrance.
Out the windows the sound of live music streams laced with singalongers.
Cars rumble and buses whine and bike bells chime on the street.
Sunshine stretches out on the asphalt and above it lights up the translucent flags that hang angled from building fronts.</p></div>

<h4 id="sunday-08102025--dublin---galway">Sunday 08/10/2025 – Dublin -&gt; Galway</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee @ Little Cactus; then breakfast &amp; coffee together</li>

  <li>pick up luggage from Airbnb &amp; get quick meal from Manor Takeaway Foods</li>
  <li>drive to Galway, settle at B&amp;B, chat with host about what to do tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At the Jameson Distillery, our host was the most animated one we’ve had in Dublin.
He waved his arms wildly and in husky bellows rattled off his lines, punctuating them with dual finger snaps and tossing of the Jameson bottle from one hand to the other, the glass clinking against his hand jewelry.
He concluded his opening speech by ramming the bottle down onto a prop book, then as if waking from a trance he commented mildly and mostly to himself that this bottle hadn’t broken.
I too was surprised.</p></div>

<h4 id="monday-08112025--galway">Monday 08/11/2025 – Galway</h4>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast @ 8am; I had a Full Irish Breakfast &amp; Z had french toast with fruits</li>

  <li>drive to Killary Fjord (scenic!); get ice cream @ Hamilton Grocery &amp; enjoy view</li>
  <li>spend evening &amp; have dinner in Galway</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This was a supremely scenic daytrip.
Exactly the kind that makes our car rental worth it.</p></div>

<h4 id="friday-08152025--dingle---killarney---cork---bristol">Friday 08/15/2025 – Dingle -&gt; Killarney -&gt; Cork -&gt; Bristol</h4>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On our hike through Glanageenty forest we spoke with Chris about various things.
At one point we got on the topic of gender and he expressed his resent for the anti-masculinity messaging he received while growing up.
Lately he had been collecting opinions from people about what it is that makes a man.
A positive definition instead of a negative one.
I offered an answer.
To be a good man, <a id="2025-08-18-be-a-man-2" class="" href="/vbook/be-a-man-2">you need self-esteem</a>.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/ireland" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p> was fantastic.
There we found the conventional tourist attractions well worth seeing.
It is making me reflect on cities and what about them makes them worth visiting.
Good food of diverse types.
Art shows like galleries, live music, and stand up comedy.
Historical landmarks and notable architecture.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A remarkable aspect of a good city is its density.
I think I have to shift my mindset.
Here it isn’t about covering ground but about drilling down in single spots.
Spending hours at a museum.
Eating a great dinner in a restaurant mere steps from another where you had breakfast.
Even returning to the same restaurant to try different items on the menu.
Doing these things feel less like exploring and adventuring.</p></div>

<h4 id="sunday-08172025--bristol">Sunday 08/17/2025 – Bristol</h4>

<ul>
  <li>sleep in; get coffee &amp; pastry from Poquito; shower &amp; dress</li>

  <li>walk to train station, ride to Bristol Temple Meads, scooter back to Montpelier</li>
  <li>get takeout from Oowee Diner and eat at Airbnb</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I can’t help but chuckle to myself sitting here on my first train trip in England.
The platform was occupied with travelers waiting for the train and when it arrived everyone flocked to the carriage entrances.
Z and I were confused to see everyone standing so close to the doors before they opened.
Wouldn’t there be people on the train already, some of whom would be disembarking here in Bristol?
Indeed there were.
The doors opened and people started trickling out, many with luggage and one with a stroller and yet the travelers waiting to board barely made way for them.
Z and I looked at each other.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Once we got on the train, we waited for people in front of us to stow luggage and find seats.
The seats were mostly occupied but we saw a few single open seats remaining so we stepped down the aisle towards them.
Nearest us there appeared to be two single seats open at either side of the aisle but when I came to what would be mine I discovered a small dog panting where he lay before a bowl of water.
I considered asking for the seat but then there were more open seats down the aisle.
Still it felt funny to give deference to a dog.
I turned to the other side of the aisle and asked the girl if she’d mind moving her luggage from the seat next to her.
To my and Z’s surprise she replied that she did mind, that she had documents in her suitcase.
I said <em>Oh, you can’t put it there?</em> pointing overhead.
She said <em>No, it doesn’t fit.</em>
Two dreadful excuses.
Z and I looked at each other again, mutual incredulity growing.
No matter, ahead were more open seats.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A woman with a baby strapped to her chest asked me for help putting her stroller in the overhead compartment.
I did and as she turned to get in her seat the backpack on her back touched the face of a middleaged man sitting across the aisle and he moaned and clutched his nose as if he’d been struck.
The mother turned to him and said <em>I’m so sorry, are you ok?</em> with all the polite concern in her tone of voice but none much on her face.
The man didn’t look at her anyway — he was still holding his face — and he waved her away and said <em>Just sit down</em>.
The mother exchanged silent looks with us and sat down.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As Z and I lurched down the aisle of the moving train towards the few remaining empty seats, nobody made to remove their bags from their adjacent seat to allow us it.
Each of us had to walk up to a passenger, look them in the face, and ask that they make their spare seat available to us.
An opportunity to interact more with the locals I suppose.</p></div>
