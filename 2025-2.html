<h4 id="saturday-12212024--sunday-12222024--tokyo-first-time-at-an-izakaya">Saturday 12/21/2024 / Sunday 12/22/2024 – Tokyo, first time at an izakaya</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I flew @ 12:45pm directly from Vancouver (YVR) -&gt; Tokyo (NRT)</li>
  <li>Z slept while the rest of us ate at a nearby izakaya (drinks, raw tuna, cheese pancakes, potato croquettes, chicken karaage, etc.)</li>
  <li>chocolate ice cream bar at 7 Eleven on the way back to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Z &amp; I flew with Air Canada.
We upgraded to Premium Economy to avoid being stuck in a couple of middle seats.
It was expensive, but it made our flight much better.
I spent the whole flight reading and writing.
I read the first 150 pages of <em>Normal People</em> and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about it</a><p>, pausing only to eat meals.
I couldn’t believe it when it was announced that we were beginning our descent.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="monday-12232024--tokyo-a-day-of-shopping">Monday 12/23/2024 – Tokyo, a day of shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee nearby while Z &amp; my family ate breakfast at the hotel</li>
  <li>together took train to Shibuya City, then ate at a good conveyor belt sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>solo flat white @ The Roastery by Nozy Coffee on Cat Street</li>
  <li>solo browse MoMA Design Store &amp; other boutiques, bought tea towel from Hay</li>
  <li>solo walk thru Shibuya, fatigued from jetlag, got another coffee</li>
  <li>solo browsed robe store but did not find what I wanted</li>
  <li>with group again, bought hoodie @ Carhartt Work In Progress store</li>
  <li>bought shoes and slides @ Hoka store</li>
  <li>visit Tadao Ando’s public bathroom in Jingū-dōri Park, which was featured in the movie <em>Perfect Days</em>
</li>
  <li>Shibuya crossing! then very spicy ramen at a place with weird vibes</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing.
Same thing this time in Tokyo for the first 24 hours.
Reactine didn’t seem to make a difference, just had to wait it out.</p></div>

<h4 id="tuesday-12242024--tokyo">Tuesday 12/24/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>arrived at Disney Sea @ 12pm</li>
  <li>rode on lots of rides, walked a lot, listened to Disney Xmas carollers</li>
  <li>subpar pizza &amp; pasta in Little Venice</li>
  <li>explored the rest of the park, rode on more rides, fought jetlag</li>
  <li>left @ 9pm, closing time</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The architecture and spatial planning of the theme park was really impressive.
It seemed like every corner we rounded we encountered another stridebreaking view of the park.
It reminded me of the architectural tactic of constraining the height and width of hallways to reinforce the impact of emerging into a bigger space.
It’s a method that’s been employed by Tadao Ando of Osaka and other famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-12252024--tokyo">Wednesday 12/25/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk through the Shimbashi area getting a couple of coffees</li>
  <li>Z &amp; I explored Ebisu on foot, stopping at a puppy store and a pharmacy</li>
  <li>cocktails @ bar EAS MOR, which had great atmosphere</li>
  <li>visited mall briefly, then dinner @ Toki Taruza withe everyone</li>
  <li>7 Eleven for snacks on the way to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="thursday-12262024--tokyo---takayama">Thursday 12/26/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>get two flat whites from INCredible Coffee</li>
  <li>took bullet train @ 1pm to Takayama via Nagoya</li>
  <li>dinner at a nice sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>fell asleep by 9pm, finally cured my jetlag</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train’s platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn’t enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying to scan our IC card after inserting the tickets.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It’s good we came an hour early.</p></div>

<h4 id="friday-12272024--takayama">Friday 12/27/2024 – Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>while Z had breakfast at the hotel, I walked into town and had coffee @ Brand New Day and then @ Hids’ Cafe</li>
  <li>at Miyagawa Morning Markets we bought a beef bun, a fridge magnet, two pairs of chopsticks, and two ceramic mugs</li>
  <li>pop into a cutlery store and then have lunch &amp; coffee @ Ember coffee in beautiful 150+ yearold house</li>
  <li>walk up hill to Shoren-ji Temple, enjoying the snowy scenery</li>
  <li>back in town, stop at stationery store</li>
  <li>I bought a yukata at a kimono store</li>
  <li>dinner @ ramen restaurant</li>
  <li>incredible cocktails @ Yu</li>
  <li>thirty minutes in a private onsen w/ Z at the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This was one of the best days of the trip.</p></div>

<h4 id="saturday-12282024--takayama---shirakawago---kanazawa">Saturday 12/28/2024 – Takayama -&gt; Shirakawago -&gt; Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk over fresh snow into town for coffee @ Falò Coffee Brewers, then got cash from post office ATM, then coffee @ Ember, before returning to hotel</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Shirakawago</li>
  <li>delicious snacks and drinks from window shop on street</li>
  <li>walk through village, across pedestrian bridge over the river, to the museum, and then back</li>
  <li>coffees &amp; Baum stick</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Kanazawa, then food &amp; drinks @ Pari King nearby</li>
  <li>beer &amp; instant ramen in the hotel room</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sunday-12292024--kanazawa">Sunday 12/29/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I had breakfast &amp; coffee at Isotope Coffee, a beautiful space</li>
  <li>solo stroll through town listening to music and taking pictures</li>
  <li>drank coffee and <a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about <em>Normal People</em></a><p> at Townsfolk Coffee</p>
</li>
  <li>Z met me and we walked north through Omigi Market for dinner at a fine dining restaurant called Barrier</li>
  <li>we walked through the Higashi Chaya District</li>
  <li>Z went to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I sat at a small pub to read <em>Normal People</em> &amp; drink beer</li>
  <li>we had cocktails at Furansu Cocktail Bar, which bartender at Yu in Takayama had recommended</li>
  <li>bites and drinks at Izakaya Hanagumi</li>
  <li>spent the rest of the night at Donuts Music Bar</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="monday-12302024--kanazawa">Monday 12/30/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast &amp; coffee at Moron Cafe</li>
  <li>visit beautiful Samurai house with an exquisite garden and a small gallery of artifacts</li>
  <li>coffee @ Townsfolk Coffee, then a brief stop at a combini store</li>
  <li>walk through to Oyama Shrine, through gardens, up to Kanazawa Castle ruins, down past Kenroku-en Garden</li>
  <li>Z took the bus to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I walked through Shiinoki Green Space back to the hotel</li>
  <li>I rested &amp; read <em>Normal People</em> in the room</li>
  <li>met Z for dinner nearby, but Love For All’s kitchen was closed so we went to The Cottage</li>
  <li>stop at Lawson, then back to hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tuesday-12312024--kanazawa---tokyo">Tuesday 12/31/2024 – Kanazawa -&gt; Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>taxi to station, ate while we waited for our train</li>
  <li>arrived in Tokyo, train to Shimbashi, checked back into the hotel</li>
  <li>rested a couple hours at the hotel</li>
  <li>dinner @ Daigo, a fancy Shojin restaurant</li>
  <li>karaoke @ Big Echo</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We were en route to Kanazawa Station by taxi when a thunderstorm hit.
Lightning flashed outside the windshield so brightly I thought our driver had run a red light and triggered a stoplight camera.
Still we asked to get dropped at a coffee shop a block away from the station so I could get a good coffee.
But then we found the shop was closed for New Years so we frantically lugged our bags back to the taxi to catch it before it left.
The train station was big and busy with travelers.
It was basically a mall with a train station.
White artificial light and Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift came down from the ceiling everywhere.
We settled in a Tully’s Coffee lounge with our bags piled around our ankles.
The far wall was decorated with a sappy, nonsensical poem marketing <em>&amp; Tea</em>.
We might as well have been in a mall in Jakarta or Mexico City or someplace else.
I hate places like these.
When you’re there, you don’t feel like you’re anywhere.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-01012024--tokyo">Wednesday 01/01/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>coffee &amp; breakfast @ Starbucks</li>
  <li>visit fancy mall where teamLAB is</li>
  <li>watched Gladiator II @ 109 Cinemas</li>
  <li>ramen dinner nearby</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It was certainly a mistake to visit Japan in the first few days of January.
As noted all over the internet, New Years is Japan’s major national holiday and many things close not only on the first but for a week.
I’m sure Z would’ve determined this if we had been more involved in planning the trip.
Lesson learned, I suppose.</p></div>

<h4 id="thursday-01022024--tokyo">Thursday 01/02/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit various neighborhoods including Gakugei-daigaku, Naka-meguro, &amp; Ebisu</li>
  <li>visited two more Tokyo Toilet locations, designed by Masamichi Katayama &amp;	Kashiwa Satō</li>
  <li>incredible sushi @ Standing Sushi Nemuro Hanamaru in Ginza</li>
  <li>shop @ UNIQLO Flagship store</li>
  <li>cocktails @ La France in Ginza</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="friday-01032024--tokyo">Friday 01/03/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit Tokyo National Museum</li>
  <li>lunch &amp; coffee there</li>
  <li>Hello Kitty special exhibition and gift shop</li>
  <li>visit Senso-ji temple w/ Z</li>
  <li>solo walk in Asakusa area</li>
  <li>dinner w/ my friend H @ Monja Shichigosan then drinks at nearby pub</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/context">mixed feelings about the museum</a><p>.
Or, I don’t know, maybe I just needed a meal.
Or a better sleep.
Or to feel like I chose to go there.
Or to have had a period earlier in the day where I’d gotten to direct my attention to things of my choosing.
Or a period to produce something, so that I might be in a more </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/chart-moods">absorptive mood</a><p>.
That certainly makes me feel better about socializing aimlessly in the evening, when I feel like I’ve done something productive with my day.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="saturday-01042024--tokyo">Saturday 01/04/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee &amp; journaling @ City Bakery</li>
  <li>teppanyaki dinner w/ my mom on top floor of mall in Ginza</li>
  <li>visit the teamLAB Borderless Digital Art Museum</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Art Museum was really cool.
It was a dark maze on the bottom floor of a fancy mall where myriad projectors shone moving patterns and images of light on walls, floors, and ceilings.
This by itself might’ve been a gimmicky socialmedia tourist trap, but embedded throughout the large labyrinthine gallery were rooms where sculptural elements combined with light, music, and mirrors to create surreal experiences.</p></div>

<h4 id="sunday-01052024--tokyo---vancouver">Sunday 01/05/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Vancouver</h4>

<ul>
  <li>check out but leave bags at hotel</li>
  <li>solo cortado from Brooklyn Roasters in Ginza</li>
  <li>solo browse flea market &amp; buy orange tinted glass to use for cappuccinos at home</li>
  <li>pick up bags at hotel and take train to Narita</li>
  <li>flew directly @ 6pm from Tokyo (NRT) -&gt; Vancouver (YVR)</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My intention was to browse Hands and Itoya in Ginza, but I came across the flea market when I stopped for coffee by Ginza station.
There were dozens of stalls selling ceramics, porcelain, kimonos, jackets, bluedyed fabrics, and so on.
The orange tinted glass I bought was only 400 yen, less than three dollars in USD, and I could see it selling for tens times the amount at trendy stores in the USA and Canada.
I’m still sour about going to the East Vancouver “Flea Market” to find they charge an <em>admission fee</em> and sell priced up secondhand and vintagestyled clothing.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve read seven chapters so far.
Here are some thoughts and some excerpts.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Describing Kenneth O’Keefe’s arrival in a coastal Irish village to visit his friend Sebastian Bullion Dangerfield at his home, who greets O’Keefe at the door:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>It was a steep hill up to Balscaddoon.
Winding close to the houses and the neighbor’s eyes having a look.
Fog over the flat water.
And the figure hunched up the road.
On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Within the doorway, smiles, wearing white golfing shoes and tan trousers suspended with bits of wire.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>O’Keefe the visitor takes in the scenery:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Delightfully written.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Later in the book, describing Dangerfield’s tiny new home:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[You] didn’t want to walk too fast in the front door or you’d find yourself going out the back.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I purposefully went into the book blind and I’m pleasantly surprised to learn that its writing style is quite experimental.
Stream of consciousness, unquoted dialogue mashed in.
It reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson for its style and subject matter.
Lecherous, base protagonists hurtling through life incurring all manner of debts with no regard for consequence and no semblance of restraint.
But in this one we catch more glimpses of the desperation and self-loathing that plauge rabid gluttons following their excesses and that trigger further indulgence.
Here the aftermath of one of Dangerfield’s odious bursts of verbal abuse towards his wife regarding her family:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A very red face.
Guilt.
Grinding the teeth.
Soul trying to get out of the mouth, swallowing it back into the body.
Shut out the sobs.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the first sentence of the very next paragraph Dangerfield is no longer at his house but at the bar:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He ordered a bottle of stout and a Gold Label, telling the boy to bring him another stout and Gold Label.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is one of the objects of the author’s experimentation, time.
Even on the lower gear of dialogue the speed is set high with snappy back-and-forth, each speaker on a new line, speech bare but the quotation marks.
And when the author doesn’t want to dwell on certain scenes, he accelerates through them by compounding dialogue and action into dense morsels:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They had one more round of stout and she turned and smiled and said that she must be going home.
And may I take you?
That’s all right.
I insist.
It’s really not necessary.
For the joy that’s in it then.
O.K.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>They set off along Suffolk Street, into the Wicklow Street and up the Great George’s.
And over there Thomas Moore was born.
Come in and see it, a nice public house indeed.
But I must go home and wash my hair.
But just a quick one.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>In they went.
The embarrassed figures looking at them and bird whispering.
The man showed them to a booth, but Mr. Dangerfield said that they were just in for a fast one.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>O surely, sir and it’s a grand evening. ‘Tis that.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The author slows the pace the most when he puts us inside Dangerfield’s head amongst his thoughts.
Him regarding his wife:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Long limbed Marion settled in the chair.
What makes you so tall and slender.
You raise your eyelids and cross your legs with something I like and wear sexless shoes with sexiness.
And Marion I’ll say this for you, you’re not blatant.
And when we get our house in the West with Kerry cattle out on the hills sucking up the grass and I’m Dangerfield K.C., things will be fine again.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like moments of contemplation imply pause.
We linger with the protagonist’s thoughts.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It continues:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A tram pounding by the window, grinding, swaying and rattling on its tracks to Dalkey.
A comforting sound.
Maps shaking on the wall.
Ireland a country of toys.
And maybe I ought to go over to Marion on the couch.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Soon and without warning the author teleports us into the next scene:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In the bedroom, Dangerfield rubbing stockinged feet on the cold linoleum.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I see many similarities to Cormac McCarthy’s writing.
Most obvious is dialogue, written without attribution, qualification, or descriptive supplement.
Deft and witty, stripped of boilerplate and stilts.
McCarthy took it a step further by dropping the quotation marks.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another obvious similarity to McCarthy’s writing is the grammatically irreverant use of nonsentences.
Declarative phrases stating what there is.
Subject only.
McCarthy’s use of these is ample yet perhaps more restrained and refined.
Donleavy showers us with them.
Another choice that quickens the pace of his writing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A third and more subtle similitude is in the varying order that clauses appear between periods.
Sentences structured shrewdly for effect and interest.
For example, to withhold predominant details and reveal them at the end to simulate their discovery.
From the first excerpt I shared:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>On top it leveled and set in a concrete wall was a green door.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Two structural inversions in one sentence but most important is the second.
The green door’s position at the end of the sentence grants it importance, intrigue even.
We anticipate crossing the threshold.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Donleavy’s sentence structures are most pleasing when they eliminate commas and let his words come into direct contact.
Reproducing an excerpt I shared at the beginning:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Standing on the shaggy grass he gave a shrill whistle as he looked down precipitous rocks to the swells of sea many feet below.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s vivid in part because each detail blends into the next.
Instead of being given parts one at a time, we experience the image fluidly as one.
McCarthy uses this technique as well.
In his magnum opus <em>Blood Meridian</em> he conjures striking images from masterfully engineered sentences.
Here is the fourth sentence of the novel:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sentences like these are carefully configured to eliminate cruft like “there are” and even suffixes like “–ing” that weaken verbs.
McCarthy opts for a touch of ambiguity by placing “darker woods” first instead of putting it after “beyond that” and consequently doubling “that”:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>rags of snow and beyond that darker woods that harbor yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>He also rejects the “–ing” solution to the problem:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>rags of snow and beyond that darker woods harboring yet a few last wolves.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is up to the writer and their sense of style to evaluate their options.
But they have to know how to generate them in the first place.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A fourth technique that Donleavy and McCarthy (and Hemingway) employ is generous use of “and” to string together images.
A snippet of an excerpt from <em>The Ginger Man</em> shared earlier:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They had one more round of stout and she turned and smiled and said that she must be going home.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Blood Meridian</em> contains extreme examples.
Here is a single sentence near the end of chapter thirteen:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>They trampled the spot with their horses until it looked much like the road again and the smoking gunlocks and sabreblades and girthrings were dragged from the ashes of the fire and carried away and buried in a separate place and the riderless horses hazed off into the desert and in the evening the wind carried the ashes and the wind blew in the night and fanned the last smoldering billets and drove forth the last fragile race of sparks fugitive as flintstrikings in the unanimous dark of the world.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>That last bit is brilliant.
Again:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[the wind] drove forth the last fragile race of sparks fugitive as flintstrikings in the unanimous dark of the world.</p></div>
</blockquote>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>This book seems to be mostly about abuse, often violent, inflicted by men against women.
<!--more-->
Its depictions are brief, detached, yet powerful.
They speak from the victims’ perspectives in a tone that evokes quiet despair, adaptive dissociation, and steely resilience.
Protagonists endure brutality and survive it at the cost of deep internal fragmentation.
There seems to be no heartening message or moral of sort, just the observation that unchecked narcissism and cruelty abound in men of our world and that the victims however scarred and burdened they may be carry on as the version of themselves that remains alive.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I suppose all of the above serves in no way as a useful recommendation.
But I should say that not all stories in this book deal with brutality and abuse, and even those that do have more things than shock and sorrow to offer.
Foremost is Scanlan’s unique yet accessible prose, which she assiduously pruned, tuned, and polished into remarkable little language contraptions.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As described in the New Yorker:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In all her books, Scanlan writes about ordinary life in extraordinary ways by compacting it radically, like pressurizing carbon into diamonds.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanlan continued this practice in novel form with <em>Kick the Latch</em>, which came out two years later in 2022.
For me, she is one of the most exciting prose writers working today.</p></div>

<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="biking-around-east-vancouver">biking around East Vancouver</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Biking is a great way to achieve my daily goal of exercising.
Seattle is prohibitively hilly but Vancouver has a great network of bike routes allocated on streets with sparse car traffic.
They have a detailed PDF file available online that maps their location and marks them with useful information like incline and degree of separation from car traffic.
I came up with a great acronym to remember the street names of the main bike routes in the area: W.A.L.K.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-the-ginger-man">reading <em>The Ginger Man</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I bought a copy last summer and finally started it last week.
I can see why Cormac McCarthy liked it.
It also reminds me a lot of <em>Fear and Loathing in Last Vegas</em>.
After finishing the seventh chapter I sat down and wrote an </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/ginger-man">initial review</a><p> of it.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="finding-z-a-new-apartment">finding Z a new apartment</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z’s apartment in Vancouver is a spacious one bedroom with a generous balcony.
It is recently renovated with tons of integrated storage but it lacks a crucial feature: a second bedroom.
I spend a lot of time at Z’s place and when I do we often both work from home.
We have comfortable workstations at opposite corners of the living room but the distance does little when one of us actively participates in a virtual meeting.
Noisecancelling headphones help but they also encourage us to speak loudly.
And even when we both work silently it’s too easy to call out across the room to ask a question, share a thought, or make a comment.
Both of us have a habit of voicing things soon after they occur to us.
It makes for interesting conversation and for a disruptive work environment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve been keeping an eye out and finally we found a good two bedroom apartment in a lively, artsy part of East Vancouver.
It costs almost the same as Z’s current place and it offers great physical separation between the two bedrooms.
We will be sad to leave Z’s current place and the neighborhood it’s in, but we’re excited for the new chapter.</p></div>

<h3 id="trying-to-become-a-planner">trying to become a planner</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t mean a city planner.
Although I do fantasize about getting involved with municipal politics someday.
I mean a life planner.
I want to get better at making plans and adhering to them.
I get a lot of stuff done in my life through what I call </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/progress-without-planning">coherent impulses</a><p>, which have proved effective but lack certain special powers particular to planning.
I’ve been ruminating on it and noticing when people make reference to it in their way of working.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In his podcast <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2d0fpifQoLn230QaGjrW7w?si=c4dc3ff353e74c77"><em>Approachable Music</em></a> Kiefer mentioned he keeps a to-do list and everyday he attends to one item at a time.
I assume many people follow this approach.
But I don’t.
I keep to-do lists but my adherence to them is erratic.
I suppose part of the problem is that many items have no inherent deadline and even those that do don’t threaten much consequence.
If I for example neglect to plan an itinerary for a trip, I can still show up and improvise as long as my flights and hotel are booked.
That’s what I did in 2019 when I went on my multimonth trip abroad to Mexico, New York, and Europe.
And I enjoyed the fruits of spontaneity and just-in-time internet searches, but without a doubt I missed out on experiences that research and forethought would’ve enabled.
I want to reduce these kinds of losses by procrastinating less and planning more.
I want to change my habit.
So I’m trying to draw my attention to the benefits of planning and override the anxious avoidance that thwarts my planning impulses.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jared Henderson, a former professor who is now a literary YouTuber, <a href="https://youtu.be/5rrJ6RReYnA?si=sHhJhHoCTYPCjJfk">mentioned</a> that he keeps a list of books he will read.
I don’t.
I keep track of books that I might want to read by saving them <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/57048915">on Goodreads</a>, but I never reference that list when deciding which book to read next.
My methods are spontaneous and informally organized.
I try out audiobooks on Spotify and Libby and continue them if I feel motivated to do so.
I buy books impulsively and shelve them affectionately next to my other unreads.
When I am ready to start a new book I eye my collection shiftily and grab the candidates my whims command me to and then I bring them to a comfortable seat in my apartment where I select one uneasily and crack it open.
Then I read stingily, hesitant to imply by reading more than a couple paragraphs that I’ve now committed to My Next Book, that this is it, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/ditch-books">I must read this book through now</a><p> or else I will have left one unfinished.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m trying something new.
I’m writing a list of books I intend to read this year.
In a way, my dabbling with planning in this way is a sort of coherent impulse.
The coherence comes from the deliberate intention to exploit the benefits of forethought and the impulse is the list of fifteen or so books I slashed out based on my current interest and appetite as well as the current contents of my shelves.
The list is unordered so I may choose to read them in any order I like and read multiple at the same time if I so wish.
I will still entertain my penchant for sampling books impulsively via Spotify and Libby, but my main reading project this year will be dictated by my list.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep biking.
Continue striving to do every day each of the following: work, read, exercise, write, enjoy, grow, discuss, plan, and socialize</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Finalize Z’s moving plans.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Go snowboarding with Z multiple times.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read the rest of <em>The Ginger Man</em> to keep up a good reading pace for the year.
After I finish it I will start <em>Malone Dies</em> unless it doesn’t </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/progress-without-planning">suit my appetite</a><p>, in which case I will pick up one of the other books on my list for 2025.</p>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>The premise and the set are both interesting, but for so long I’m just waiting for something to happen.
<!--more-->
I want to feel like a mystery is unfolding before me, that the answer to each of my questions raises another even more fervently in need of addressing.
But instead I feel like the writers are withholding information, stalling for time.
My intrigue wanes into restlessness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The pace jolts into high gear at the end of season one, when the writers finally show their cards.
All this time they have been sitting on highgrade, plotpromising bombshells.
And as the season finale approaches, it’s finally time to drop them.
Yes, what a thrill.
But I don’t feel so much shocked and swayed as I do manipulated.
Is this any way to tell a story?
Create a sudden climax and end it right there, with not even the beginnings of resolution?
Why didn’t the writers introduce the same ideas earlier in the season and develop them throughout?
We all know the answer already.
In the end, <em>Severance</em> is more asset than art.
It is, above all, a strategic allocation for growing Apple’s share of the streaming market.
And how do you keep people watching?
You end on a cliffhanger.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As a viewer, I feel my interest being managed and manipulated rather than being cultivated.
I don’t feel like a thrilling story is being recounted for my entertainment, I feel like I’m being sold a product.
<em>Please keep watching, we promise something interesting is coming soon.</em>
I’m sure there are people involved in making <em>Severance</em> that want to make genuinely good TV but the overall effort seems to me more like hedging than striving.
It’s ironic when you consider that Lumon’s closest analogue in the real world might in fact be Apple.
There is the cultlike adulation of a heroic founder, the snaking corporate campus enshrouded in dark glass, the obnoxious secrecy, and so on, but the most meaningful similarity is the basic one.
They are gigantic tech corporations held aloft by myths of technotopian supremacy and driven by an everincreasing hunger for growth and expansion.
(Also, Lumon sounds like Lemon.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The basics of telling a good story is like playing chess.
You can’t rely on sneak attacks or smuggled secrets.
The pieces and the tensions between them are all in plain view, brought into position one step a time.
The tensions build until there comes a natural point when the deadlock breaks and the inevitable drama ensues.
Consequences ripple and trigger further action.
There is no need to contrive plot.
It flows out of confrontation between agents in the story.
If nothing happens its because the people moving the pieces don’t know what they are doing.
Or they’re holding back.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The writers of <em>Severance</em> might well know how to write a good story.
But I think the problem is that the real chess is being played by Apple, who is mobilizing their pieces – <em>Severance</em>, <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and so on – to corner a share of the market.
Their ultimate goal is not to make compelling television, but to compel us to keep watching.</p></div>

In this book, Burkeman picks up where he left off in his previous one – <a id="2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks" class="" href="/vbook/four-thousand-weeks"><em>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em></a> – by revisting the grim fact that a lifetime is a <a id="2023-03-22-live-in-the-moment" class="" href="/vbook/live-in-the-moment">prohibitively brief window of time</a> to achieve even a fraction of the things we propose to do.
Burkeman’s mention of mortality in the naming of his books is not an empty gesture or a marketing gambit.
His writings on the topic of time-management and day-to-day living take death out of the subtext and put it where it belongs, in the text itself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This book offers a series of cleverly angled perspectives that transform problems by considering them differently.
Each chapter begins with a quote and Chapter Three begins with a brilliant one from Sheldon Bernard Kopp:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>You are free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is not a fantasy of omnipotence, but an energizing reminder of the control you <em>do</em> have.
Reframing my role in this way – from unwilling object to autonomous subject – freed me from the futile and exhausting cycle of resent towards my circumstances and refocused my attention on what I was doing about them.
As Burkeman phrases it:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[Sometimes you’ll] do the undesirable thing because you understand the cost and you <em>don’t</em> want to incur it. Notice how different that is, how different it feels from grudgingly saying yes because you feel you have no choice, then resenting it for days.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In short, there are two options.
Do nothing and accept the consequences, or do what you can to get the result you want.
Idle rage makes no sense.
If the consequences are unacceptable then do something about them.
If they are acceptable, accept them and move on.
This directive prompts another liberating insight:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Most of the potential consequences we find ourselves agonizing about don’t remotely justify such angst.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This also helped me enormously.
It simplified my conundrum by helping me realize that my primary task was to eliminate risk of actual harm befalling me and reducing the likelihood of costly consequences.
That done, as long as I can fiscally, emotionally, and physically afford the potential consequences, there is no reason to worry like I am in danger.</p></div>

<h4 id="tuesday-12162025--cancun--bacalar">Tuesday 12/16/2025 – Cancun → Bacalar</h4>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast buffet @ hotel</li>
  <li>cab to Tren Maya station, ride train to Bacalar</li>
  <li>cab to hotel, Rancho Encantado; check in; eat lunch</li>
  <li>take private boat tour of the lagoon, stopping at cenotes &amp; channel to swim</li>
  <li>go in hot tub with my mom and drink a beer</li>
  <li>rest in room; shower; do digital chores</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m impressed by the Tren Maya.
Not by how well it works but by the mere fact it exists.
It’s not the kind of thing I would expect to see in Mexico.
Admittedly, it’s no bullet train.
From Cancun to Tulum it takes an hour forty, the same travel time by car.
And it only runs a few times per day.
But it only opened last year and it connects the Mexican southeast.
We’ve mentioned it to servers, cab drivers, desk clerks, but no one we’ve spoken to has taken it.
On this one today there are a few dozen passengers but what strikes me is the number of workers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To enter the platform, we show our printed tickets and identification before progressing to automated gates where a lady instructs us to scan our QR code in the typical place at the front of the gate.
It beeps and opens to let us through.
A step past it on the other side another lady motions us forward toward the metal detector a few feet away and tells us to line up on the right side.
Four or five uniformed officers stand at the one metal detector, feeding in bags and baskets into it on the conveyor belt on one side and taking them off on the other side.
Once seated on the train a man comes down the aisle asking for tickets but when I mutter I don’t know where I put it he just confirms our destination before continuing down the aisle.
At each station we pass uniformed officers of the <em>Guardia Nacional</em> stand and traipse around while several cleaning ladies sweep and mop already tidylooking floors.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This morning when we came out onto the train platform a worker greeted us and queried about our assigned train car.
We told him and he led us to a particular spot on the platform marked with yellow and black tape to which our car would align when the train arrived.
Already I thought this was unnecessary information but then to my surprise he explained a few more things.
Please stay behind the yellow line, when the train arrives let passengers get off before boarding, and please bear in mind while doing so that there will be a gap between the station and the train, and if you happen to drop a belonging into it do no try to retrieve it – be it a cellphone, a bag, a pair of sunglasses – do no try to retrieve it, that’s what we are here for, we will retrieve it for you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I was very amused by our Uber driver.
His straightfaced, irreverent demeanor reminded me of one of my Dad’s best friends.
<em>They’ve been closing streets every Sunday</em> he said.

We went in one direction and then another and then another, in search of a way out of the city.
We came to an empty intersection where a policeman stood wearing a high visibility vest and holding a whistle in his mouth.
I suggested we ask him for directions to the airport.
Our driver said nothing to me but rolled down the window and asked the policeman, <em>Y para el aeropuerto?</em>
The policeman had no idea.
He muttered apologetically, maybe this way, maybe that way.
As we drove away our driver remarked with no change in expression that we may as well have asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantinflas">Cantinflas</a>.</p></div>
