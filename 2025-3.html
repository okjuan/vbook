I made a list not because I wanted to focus on particular themes, styles, or topics but because I wanted to challenge myself to stick to a plan and to read copiously.\n\nWhat I discovered is that my reading throughput increases if I allow certain kinds of books into the mix. In the spring there was a period when I read more because I was reading two books in parallel, &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;. Emotionally neither book is light but in &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; the writing is simple and grounded and the story is straightforward and swift. When I had time to read but picking up &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt; felt like a task, it was easy to fan open &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; instead. In the afternoons and early evenings when the weather was nice enough I went out into the neighborhood with both books in my bag and by the time I found a seat I knew which one better suited my appetite.\n&quot;}]"

It&#39;s a great option when I come home tired and sweaty from a soccer game. I don&#39;t have to wait until after I shower to rest, I can do it &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; I bathe.

Public outcry culminated in the theatre&#39;s rescue by the likes of Sean Baker and other notable names in contemporary film and TV, one of Vancouver&#39;s major industries. (Most recently I discovered Cinematheque in downtown Vancouver, a nonprofit theatre that shows international and independent films.) I&#39;m heartened that management at the Rio Theatre, another beloved local venue, will be taking over operation of The Park. It remains to be seen whether the 120mm film projector will survive the transition.&quot;}]"

It&#39;s a beautiful and strange place – a remote seaside colony where avid surfers who have come from the Commonwealth at large labor for the leisures of wealthy soujourners in exchange for an idyllic stint on the raw edge of the Pacific. They work as baristas, servers, cooks, surf instructors, and they&#39;re all quite happy. No doubt for most this is a temporary situation. I imagine they live in blissful awareness of a fleeting golden period, a time of very little responsibility and immense immediate freedom. Whatever serious pursuit they may have abandoned or postponed to come here can wait because they have time on their side and joy today.&quot;}]"

I agree that public services and infrastructure need to scale with the city&#39;s growth but I am optimistic about the city&#39;s ability and willingness to accomplish that. There is plenty of evidence of it.\n\nThe city is building a brand new subway line connecting the hearts of East and West Vancouver and were it not for the selfish NIMBYism of wealthy West Vancouverites it might&#39;ve extended all the way to the University of British Columbia on the far western edge. In coordination with the construction of this new subway and in keeping with the province&#39;s Transit Oriented Development (TOA) designation, the city has stipulated minimum building heights and target proportions of affordable housing among other criteria.\n\nBeyond this major project, which is called The Broadway Plan, the city has identified particular neighborhoods that show potential to develop into lively practical urban nodes of the kind that exist elsewhere already. The city is changing, and not only do the underlying motivations seem positive and progressive but so does the planning seem competent and ambitious.\n&quot;}]"

It sounds silly and trivial until you see reality itself change shape in one way and neglect to do so in another way in attempts to adhere to bureacracatic decree.\n\nWatching meetings of the Vancouver City Council has opened my eyes to the immense power at play in city politics. Boring and dry as the meetings may be, they play an influential role in shaping material reality. Normally, meetings and bureaucratic processes stultify me, but in this case I feel galvanized. I see an intelligible process of consequence and one in which I could participate.\n&quot;}]"

I expect they are fairly obvious: sleep, hydration, diet, and fitness.\n\nFor a few months now I&#39;ve wanted to delve into the topic of hydration. What I know I&#39;ve learned from two main sources. One is conventional wisdom – you need not just water but electrolytes, for example – and the other is selfobservation. From the latter I&#39;ve noticed I crave foods like soup and certain vegetables when I&#39;m not just hungry but thirsty.

One day he gave me a pair of jeans he&#39;d assembled from three others. They were roomy at the top and tapered at the bottom, exactly the kind I wanted. They didn&#39;t fit him well but they suited me perfectly.\n\nZ has a sewing machine that her grandmother gifted her and she has regularly encouraged me to try my hand at it. She knows I&#39;m interested and whenever the opportunity arises to shirk restrictions on activities and behaviors based on gender she promotes it. So on a statutory holiday I finally did. It took me a couple hours of watching and rewatching YouTube videos and cursing the thread&#39;s disinterest in passing through the eye of the needle but finally I got the machine to do my will.
