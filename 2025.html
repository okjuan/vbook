<!--more-->
One of the attributes of “<a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual books</a>” that most intrigues me is their <strong>dynamism</strong>, the fact that they can change over time.
It excites me not only for its practicality, but for the artistic possibilities it enables.
As I wrote originally in <em>The Virtual Book</em> and then reproduced in <a id="2022-06-11-show-instead-of-telling" class="" href="/vbook/show-instead-of-telling">one</a> of its separated pieces on this site:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this journal I intend to do something like the hypothetical memoirist.
Throughout the year, whenever I feel so inclined, I will write here about events that might happen, are happening, or have happened in 2025.
I think it will be interesting to juxtapose my expectations, experiences, and reflections throughout the year.
I hope it will neutralize the bias we typically grant hindsight, which is a privileged perspective but not a consummate one.</p></div>

<h3 id="january">January</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 11 2025</em> –
I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.
Change it not majorly, but minorly.
I intend to live in the same place, work the same job, drink the same coffee.
But I want to sharpen my focus.
I intend to withhold my attention a bit more and marshall it with more discipline towards things that matter.
That doesn’t mean I will scold myself if I waste time or spend it on unimportant things.
But I want to try everyday to dedicate <em>more</em> attention to things that matter, to things that will accumulate rather than disappear into the void like jewelry into the drain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I will continue resisting idealistic aspirations towards abstract virtue, but will try to submit myself to disciplines that I trust will render concrete results.
Spending more time reading.
Waking earlier.
Avoiding cheap distractions that undermine opportunities to spend time meaningfully.
I’m not so interested in deeming time spent scrolling on instagram or passively consuming recommended YouTube videos as immoral.
It is not bad to produce nothing or learn nothing for a few minutes on a random day, but it is costly to let it become a habit.
Costly in time and in opportunity.
I don’t believe I’m particularly special but I do think there is a version of me at eightysomething years old that looks back with some sastifaction at his life’s work.
I want to do something meaningful and I know the steady progress of minutes hours and days can lead to things that irregular bouts of inspiration can imagine but never produce.</p></div>

<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="missing-japan">missing Japan</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just got back </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/japan">from Japan</a><p>.
I would love to live there for a while.
I looked it up and they do offer a six month Digital Nomad visa.
But Z’s work is partly in person and there’s probably not much she could do in Japan.
She wants to develop her career, so working as an English teacher or something of the sort would not be useful.
In any case, I am sure we will visit again.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="losing-weight">losing weight</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am twenty pounds lighter than I was a year and a half ago.
I still want to lose another twenty.
I am trying to eat very consciously and exercise everyday.
I feel optimistic.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-daily-routines">experimenting with daily routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last few days I have woken up early and immediately gone out on a walk with my coffee.
It’s a lovely way to warm up for the day and start by accomplishing my daily task of exercising.
Walking is useful for me given that I am a homebody with a remote computer job and a reliance on soccer for exercise.
After returning from my morning walk I’ve spent time reading before getting on with my day.
An aspiration I’ve set for myself is to exercise, read, write, work, enjoy, socialize, discuss, grow, and plan every day.
It sounds cheesy, I know.
But they are generalizations of more specific intentions I have for 2025.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December I received my expected promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
It’s a milestone in my career.
The pay bump was nice if modest for industry standards, but the biggest perk is the greater influence I am already wielding as part of the increase in my responsibilities.
I have strong opinions on how certain things should be done and I feel already a boost in persuasive power generated from my new title.
I feel like I have more agency and I welcome it.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-writing-and-avoiding-distractions">reading, writing, and avoiding distractions</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Matthew B. Crawford’s </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/world-beyond-your-head"><em>The World Beyond Your Head</em></a><p> has provoked in me a lot of reflection about what things consume my attention and how </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/attention">environ</a><p></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/attention-2">ments</a><p> dictate that.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I recently read </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/molloy"><em>Molloy</em></a><p> by Samuel Beckett and I intend to continue with the second book in the trilogy.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also resumed reading and marveling at the prose in <em>Blood Meridian</em>.
I think it appropriate to take my time with what Harold Bloom called  “the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.”</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year as soon as the weather started cooling and days darkening early I started watching movies.
In the last few months I’ve watched <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, <em>We Live In Time</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Godfather Part 2</em>, <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>Anora</em>, <em>A Real Pain</em>, <em>Perfect Days</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em>, and <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.
Reviews and ratings for these are or will be on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/okjuanito/films/reviews/">my letterboxd account</a>.
Tomorrow I’m going to watch <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p></div>

<h3 id="following-arsenal">following Arsenal</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following the English Premier League is so interesting because it’s so competitive.
It is so difficult for teams to win.
It is so difficult for fans or pundits to predict what will happen.
New players arrive, old ones fall away, young ones rise into prominence.
It’s a lucrative business but it is also genuine, gripping drama.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The year 2025 is a blank canvas.
We don’t have any specific plans.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways.
But perhaps more so, it is open ended.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I begin the year with several intentions.
Do big things at work.
Get fitter.
Lose twenty pounds.
Have more discussions with friends.
Read copiously.
Keep writing for and developing this site.
Nurture friendships.
Heal and grow.
Enjoy our DINK status.
Ruminate on longterm plans.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>Enjoying stillness, listening to Harold Bloom interviews, watching movies, and experimenting with routines.
<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="enjoying-stillness">enjoying stillness</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite the fact I’ve only <a id="2020-01-12-ditch-books" class="" href="/vbook/ditch-books">partially</a> read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13136146-the-listening-book"><em>The Listening Book</em></a> and <a id="2024-08-11-end-of-absence" class="" href="/vbook/end-of-absence"><em>The End of Absence</em></a>, and despite my criticism of the latter, both books have helped me <a id="2025-01-22-be-still" class="" href="/vbook/stillness">savor moments of quiet and stillness</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="listening-to-harold-bloom-interviews">listening to Harold Bloom interviews</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I first encountered Harold Bloom through his words on the back cover of Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p><em>Blood Meridian</em>…seems to me clearly the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>His choice of the word <em>esthetic</em> piqued my interest because it was precisely that aspect of McCarthy’s writing that had grabbed my attention one evening almost three years ago when I opened <em>The Road</em> to its hundredth page and found I couldn’t put it down.
I owe <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/14417-open-the-book-to-page-ninety-nine-and-read-and-the">Ford Madox Ford</a> for encouraging the whim:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For more than a year now I’ve been reading <em>Blood Meridian</em> in bursts and every time I pick it back up I find myself listening to more Harold Bloom interviews.
I feel inspired and challenged by his devotion to literature and insistence on copious reading and re-reading.
I am wary of the reactionary conservatism of which he has been accused, but have so far found his perspectives intriguing and thoughtprovoking.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I recently watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brutalist"><em>The Brutalist</em></a>.
It was good, but disturbing.
It had some themes in common with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu_(2024_film)"><em>Nosferatu</em></a>, which I also watched recently and really enjoyed.
I thought the acting, the visuals, and the writing were all very good.
It is the first Robert Eggers film I’ve seen and I’m sure it won’t be the last.
I also recently watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_Room"><em>Panic Room</em></a>.
I thought it was pretty good, but the more I think about <a id="2025-01-27-panic-room" class="" href="/vbook/panic-room">how it handled themes of race and class</a> the more uncomfortable I feel about it.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-routines">experimenting with routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I continue trying to wake up early and start the day with a walk through the neighborhood.
The quiet and freshness of morning is special.
I hope to make it a habit.
I think it would transform not only my daily life but it entire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another small change I am trying is to write my <a href="/vbook/now">/now</a> update more regularly.
Usually I post one every few months.
I wrote this one less than two weeks after the <a id="2025-01-11-now" class="" href="/vbook/now-7">previous one</a>.
To achieve this, I’m trying to write the whole update in one sitting and this is the second time I’ve done it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>And to promote my goal to work, read, exercise, write, enjoy, grow, discuss, plan, and socialize everyday, I’ve put those nine words on my phone’s lock screen.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m playing soccer once a week but trying to play more.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I are going snowboarding with friends soon.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve been in a <a id="2023-11-30-chart-moods" class="" href="/vbook/chart-moods">mood for producing</a> but I intend to get back to reading in the next few days.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite all the movies I’ve watched recently, I still have appetite for more.
Lynch’s recent passing is already making some of my friends more interested in watching his films and I intend to take advantage of it.</p></div>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preparing green card papers for my wife, Z.
We probably won’t get them until early 2025.
<em>Sigh</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Enjoying the fall.
Except for the short days.
Sun sets at 4:30pm nowadays.
Blehj.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Playing soccer.
I’ve noticed in the last several months that I’m scoring more goals from longer range, 20+ yards away from goal.
I’m delighted that it’s turning out to be one of my strengths in the game.
I’d gotten used to thinking that headers and penalties were my only goal-scoring strengths.
(And, actually, I’ve gotten worse at penalties in the last several years.)
I think I’m reaping the benefits of the hours I spent in my late teens (and perhaps early twenties) practicing long-range shooting.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Losing weight.
I’ve lost ~11lbs in the last 5 months, an average of 2.2lbs per month.
If I can keep up that rate, I’ll reach my goal weight of 189lbs in 13.6 months.
Geez, that’s January 20<em>25</em>.
Sounds like early 2025 will be cathartic time for me.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve noticed my attitude towards money has shifted recently.
For years, I’ve wanted to keep open the option of taking a major career risk, so I wanted to save as much as possible.
But nowadays, I’m pretty happy and could see myself staying at Microsoft for a few more years, at least.
I am fortunate that money is not a scarce resource for me and I can use it to save time and make my life better.
I still try not to overspend, but I don’t let it dominate my decisions as much anymore.</p></div>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Went to Mexico with Z.
I was born and raised there, and she’d never been.
We went to Ixtapa, Mexico City, Queretaro, and San Miguel de Allende.</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mainly working on this site, <a href="/vbook/">okjuan.me/vbook</a>.
It’s been tricky because I don’t know any Ruby and don’t want to invest time into learning it right now.
So far, I’ve gotten by on documentation and other people’s examples.
Most recently, I added backlinks, with some <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">help from Daniel Miller</a>.
I also made tags the main way to navigate the site by folding ‘categories’ into them.
Not only is this cleaner and more uniform, but it also allows me to assign multiple categories (now tags) to the same post.
For example, a post can now be ‘filed’ under both <a href="/vbook/tags/essays/">#essays</a> and <a href="/vbook/tags/journal/">#journal</a>.
See <a href="https://www.mentalnodes.com/folders-kill-creativity">Folders kill creativity</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I still really want to make and deploy a front-end for <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot">music-lib-bot</a>.
A web app would make sense, but I also like the idea of an SMS interface or something of the like.
Maybe even something integrated into Google Assistant.</p></div>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focused on posting here, <a href="/vbook/">okjuan.me/vbook</a>.
Not working on anything for <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/">okjuan.medium.com</a> or <a href="https://okjuan.substack.com/">okjuan.substack.com</a>, although I can <a href="https://okjuan.substack.com/p/learning-to-dress">cross-post</a> like I did for </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/dress">learning to dress</a><p>.
Nothing currently in the works for <a href="https://www.206zulu.org/author/juan-carlos-gallegos/">206 Zulu</a> either.
I worked on a second piece for them earlier this year, but that stalled.
Ended up posting it </p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I just finished 2 books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked">The Courage to be Disliked</a> by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52386552-into-the-abyss">Into the Abyss: A Neuropsychiatrist’s Notes on Troubled Minds</a> by Anthony David.
<em>The Courage</em> was thought-provoking and written in a novel form.
See Derek Sivers’ <a href="https://sive.rs/book/Disliked">notes</a> on it.
<em>Into the Abyss</em> was full of fascinating cases and some good insight.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently read Anthony Lane’s hilarious New Yorker article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review">Can Happiness Be Taught?</a>
It’s a review of recent best-seller <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137978862-build-the-life-you-want">Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier</a>, written by a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School and sponsored by Oprah Winfrey.
One of my favorite bits:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>…imperative reigns supreme. “Start by working on your toughness.” No sweat. “Take your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.” Check. “Rebel against your shame.” Done. “Widen your conflict-resolution repertoire.” Ka-pow! “Treat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.” Which President? “Journal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.” Since when did “journal” turn into a transitive verb? “Dig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.” Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, “Remember: You are your own CEO.” Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year’s migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month, I read the first part of Jane Jacobs’ famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>.
To my surprise, it’s great so far.
I expected it to be much drier, as I’m sure many books about city and neighborhood planning are.
I bought a copy and intend to read it over the next couple months.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While traveling in Mexico, I read a bit of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358301-vital-little-plans">Vital Little Plans: The Short Works of Jane Jacobs</a>.
It was really good, too.
Not sure if I’ll continue reading it right now though.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last month I started listening to Stephen King’s </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/on-writing">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a><p> and was surprised at how entertaining it was.
I might keep listening.
I like reading </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/several-short-sentences">books</a><p> and memoirs about writing.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month (whew!) I also read a bit of Gloria Steinem’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within">Revolution from Within</a>, which I found on one of my dutiful visits to my local Goodwill.
It’s pretty interesting.
The story about the Royal Knights of East Harlem was really moving.
Here is <a href="https://blog.chesshouse.com/from-street-kids-to-royal-knights/">a telling of it</a>, apparently from Readers Digest, June 1989.
It reminds me of the story Charles Duhigg tells in <em>The Power of Habit</em> about the safety initiative CEO Paul O’Neill instituted at Alcoa to astounding and comprehensive effect on the company’s success.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I plan to listen to another chunk of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive">Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</a> to get some health tips.
See Derek Sivers’ <a href="https://sive.rs/book/Outlive">notes</a> on it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Flirting with starting </p>

I don’t have a very good reason to do so, though.
So we’ll see.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Sopranos for the second time.
Amazed at the writing, once again.
They follow so many characters and develop so many dynamics at the same time.
Many story lines don’t build to a climax and exist instead to develop characters and prepare future story lines.
Some just exist because they’re true to life.
Like when Carmela and Tony struggle to keep their rebellious daughter in check.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Couples Therapy, season 3.
So insightful and fascinating.
Orna is an amazing therapist.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome to Wrexham, season 2.
I don’t think any other show has made me cry as much as this one, and I think my love for soccer is only part of the reason.
The show has so much heart.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Rewatched Roma and Coco with my wife Z, who hadn’t seen either, while we were in Mexico.
I love doing activities that thematically or topically match other things I’m doing in life.</p></div>

      </div>
    </div></div><p> in November ‘23.
I’ve been journaling in various forms for years now and still I am surprised by its usefulness.
It’s so easy to forget our moods and modes, our thoughts and experiences.
I maintain that journaling is a way to live longer.
Through it and through intangible other forms of reflection I am determined to defeat the notions that time flies, that life is short.</p></div>

<h3 id="missing-japan">missing Japan</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just got back </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/japan">from Japan</a><p>.
I would love to live there for a while.
I looked it up and they do offer a six month Digital Nomad visa.
But Z’s work is partly in person and there’s probably not much she could do in Japan.
She wants to develop her career, so working as an English teacher or something of the sort would not be useful.
In any case, I am sure we will visit again.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="losing-weight">losing weight</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am twenty pounds lighter than I was a year and a half ago.
I still want to lose another twenty.
I am trying to eat very consciously and exercise everyday.
I feel optimistic.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-daily-routines">experimenting with daily routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last few days I have woken up early and immediately gone out on a walk with my coffee.
It’s a lovely way to warm up for the day and start by accomplishing my daily task of exercising.
Walking is useful for me given that I am a homebody with a remote computer job and a reliance on soccer for exercise.
After returning from my morning walk I’ve spent time reading before getting on with my day.
An aspiration I’ve set for myself is to exercise, read, write, work, enjoy, socialize, discuss, grow, and plan every day.
It sounds cheesy, I know.
But they are generalizations of more specific intentions I have for 2025.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December I received my expected promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
It’s a milestone in my career.
The pay bump was nice if modest for industry standards, but the biggest perk is the greater influence I am already wielding as part of the increase in my responsibilities.
I have strong opinions on how certain things should be done and I feel already a boost in persuasive power generated from my new title.
I feel like I have more agency and I welcome it.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year as soon as the weather started cooling and days darkening early I started watching movies.
In the last few months I’ve watched <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, <em>We Live In Time</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Godfather Part 2</em>, <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>Anora</em>, <em>A Real Pain</em>, <em>Perfect Days</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em>, and <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.
Reviews and ratings for these are or will be on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/okjuanito/films/reviews/">my letterboxd account</a>.
Tomorrow I’m going to watch <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p></div>

<h3 id="following-arsenal">following Arsenal</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following the English Premier League is so interesting because it’s so competitive.
It is so difficult for teams to win.
It is so difficult for fans or pundits to predict what will happen.
New players arrive, old ones fall away, young ones rise into prominence.
It’s a lucrative business but it is also genuine, gripping drama.</p></div>

We don’t have any specific plans.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways.

<div class="paragraph"><p>I begin the year with several intentions.
Do big things at work.
Get fitter.
Lose twenty pounds.
Have more discussions with friends.
Read copiously.
Keep writing for and developing this site.
Nurture friendships.
Heal and grow.
Enjoy our DINK status.
Ruminate on longterm plans.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’d forgotten this.
This is one of the joys of writing.
Most things I write I leave for a couple weeks while I occupy myself with new ideas only to come back to the old ones and find myself yet again intrigued and surprised by what this person who I supposedly am had to say.</p></div>

<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="biking-around-east-vancouver">biking around East Vancouver</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Biking is a great way to achieve my daily goal of exercising.
Seattle is prohibitively hilly but Vancouver has a great network of bike routes allocated on streets with sparse car traffic.
They have a detailed PDF file available online that maps their location and marks them with useful information like incline and degree of separation from car traffic.
I came up with a great acronym to remember the street names of the main bike routes in the area: W.A.L.K.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-the-ginger-man">reading <em>The Ginger Man</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I bought a copy last summer and finally started it last week.
I can see why Cormac McCarthy liked it.
It also reminds me a lot of <em>Fear and Loathing in Last Vegas</em>.
After finishing the seventh chapter I sat down and wrote an <a id="2025-01-28-the-ginger-man" class="" href="/vbook/ginger-man">initial review</a> of it.</p></div>

<h3 id="finding-z-a-new-apartment">finding Z a new apartment</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z’s apartment in Vancouver is a spacious one bedroom with a generous balcony.
It is recently renovated with tons of integrated storage but it lacks a crucial feature: a second bedroom.
I spend a lot of time at Z’s place and when I do we often both work from home.
We have comfortable workstations at opposite corners of the living room but the distance does little when one of us actively participates in a virtual meeting.
Noisecancelling headphones help but they also encourage us to speak loudly.
And even when we both work silently it’s too easy to call out across the room to ask a question, share a thought, or make a comment.
Both of us have a habit of voicing things soon after they occur to us.
It makes for interesting conversation and for a disruptive work environment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve been keeping an eye out and finally we found a good two bedroom apartment in a lively, artsy part of East Vancouver.
It costs almost the same as Z’s current place and it offers great physical separation between the two bedrooms.
We will be sad to leave Z’s current place and the neighborhood it’s in, but we’re excited for the new chapter.</p></div>

<h3 id="trying-to-become-a-planner">trying to become a planner</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t mean a city planner.
Although I do fantasize about getting involved with municipal politics someday.
I mean a life planner.
I want to get better at making plans and adhering to them.
I get a lot of stuff done in my life through what I call <a id="2023-01-28-progress-without-planning" class="" href="/vbook/progress-without-planning">coherent impulses</a>, which have proved effective but lack certain special powers particular to planning.
I’ve been ruminating on it and noticing when people make reference to it in their way of working.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In his podcast <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2d0fpifQoLn230QaGjrW7w?si=c4dc3ff353e74c77"><em>Approachable Music</em></a> Kiefer mentioned he keeps a to-do list and everyday he attends to one item at a time.
I assume many people follow this approach.
But I don’t.
I keep to-do lists but my adherence to them is erratic.
I suppose part of the problem is that many items have no inherent deadline and even those that do don’t threaten much consequence.
If I for example neglect to plan an itinerary for a trip, I can still show up and improvise as long as my flights and hotel are booked.
That’s what I did in 2019 when I went on my multimonth trip abroad to Mexico, New York, and Europe.
And I enjoyed the fruits of spontaneity and just-in-time internet searches, but without a doubt I missed out on experiences that research and forethought would’ve enabled.
I want to reduce these kinds of losses by procrastinating less and planning more.
I want to change my habit.
So I’m trying to draw my attention to the benefits of planning and override the anxious avoidance that thwarts my planning impulses.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Jared Henderson, a former professor who is now a literary YouTuber, <a href="https://youtu.be/5rrJ6RReYnA?si=sHhJhHoCTYPCjJfk">mentioned</a> that he keeps a list of books he will read.
I don’t.
I keep track of books that I might want to read by saving them <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/57048915">on Goodreads</a>, but I never reference that list when deciding which book to read next.
My methods are spontaneous and informally organized.
I try out audiobooks on Spotify and Libby and continue them if I feel motivated to do so.
I buy books impulsively and shelve them affectionately next to my other unreads.
When I am ready to start a new book I eye my collection shiftily and grab the candidates my whims command me to and then I bring them to a comfortable seat in my apartment where I select one uneasily and crack it open.
Then I read stingily, hesitant to imply by reading more than a couple paragraphs that I’ve now committed to My Next Book, that this is it, <a id="2020-01-12-ditch-books" class="" href="/vbook/ditch-books">I must read this book through now</a> or else I will have left one unfinished.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m trying something new.
I’m writing a list of books I intend to read this year.
In a way, my dabbling with planning in this way is a sort of coherent impulse.
The coherence comes from the deliberate intention to exploit the benefits of forethought and the impulse is the list of fifteen or so books I slashed out based on my current interest and appetite as well as the current contents of my shelves.
The list is unordered so I may choose to read them in any order I like and read multiple at the same time if I so wish.
I will still entertain my penchant for sampling books impulsively via Spotify and Libby, but my main reading project this year will be dictated by my list.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
As foretold the annual snowdump came down in February, this time on the very first evening of the month.
For people like me that rely on outdoor sports like soccer and biking for exercise it’s rather inconvenient but that inconvenience is more than repaid in stunning views of snowcovered mountains looming above the clouds, lit in the early sunset.
Not to mention the ease with which one could drive up one of those mountains for a weekday evening of skiing in Vancouver.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I go on leisurely trudges through the neighborhood to soak up the scene.
A few blocks from our apartment I encounter a middleaged man working with a shovel.
I don’t know his name but I’ve seen him on my walks in the spring and summer tending to a neighborhood garden in the nearby rotunda.
Today he is on the sidewalk scraping off snow and peppering blue salt into the gash as if to cauterize it.
I greet him and he responds with a grin.
<em>Living the dream!</em> he says.
On the roads his mechanized counterpart heaves aside mounds of snow effortlessly and from its back showers a trail of salt.
I walk ten minutes to one of the sushi restaurants in the area to pick up my lunch.
Too hungry to wait until I get home I pause and stand beneath the awning outside the restaurant and drink my miso soup and watch the neighborhood go on without me on its natural rhythm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>June 24 2025</em> –
The decision Z and I made in February to upgrade apartments in Vancouver was a brilliant one.
For a while, we’d been pining for a second bedroom.
Because we both work from home most of the time, our one bedroom apartment was proving to be an uncomfortable fit.
So every few months I would scan Facebook Marketplace for rentals and we even visited a few, but we never found anything good enough.
Then, one evening, after watching a YouTube video about rent decline in Canadian cities, I searched again.
This time, I found one option that looked good.
A few days later we went to the open house and that same afternoon we submitted our application.
Z was anxious and hesitant about making the change but with the passing of time it has only gotten clearer that our decision was a good one.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The move improved our lives substantially.
With the second bedroom we gained not only a separate workspace but also a room to host family and friends.
Also, our new apartment is in a fantastic location, mere steps off The Drive.
We have within a five minute walk grocery stores, parks, a public library, a community centre, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, stores, thrift shops, boutiques, and so on.
This was no accident.
In the summer of 2023, we spent a couple days driving around Vancouver in search of the neighborhood in which we’d most want to live.
This one was the winner.
Twenty months later, the opportunity arose and we pounced.</p></div>

<h3 id="thinking-of-sentences">thinking of sentences</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Two years after <a id="2023-02-25-several-short-sentences" class="" href="/vbook/several-short-sentences">reading about it</a>, I’m finally doing Verlyn Klinkenborg’s writing exercise of mentally formulating sentences without writing them down.
I find myself doing it habitually, out of interest.
In the shower while I think over the week’s events.
Standing on the balcony in the quiet of morning and watching a neighbor walk their dog over snowy pavement.
One word at a time I lay out a sentence in my head, pruning clutter, swapping out imprecisions, and toying with the order of clauses.
I expect it will make me a better writer.
A lovely surprise was noticing it <a id="2025-03-08-live-in-the-moment-2" class="" href="/vbook/live-in-the-moment-2">making me more present</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-pachinko--the-dominant-animal">reading <em>Pachinko</em> &amp; <em>The Dominant Animal</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After finishing <a id="2025-01-28-the-ginger-man" class="" href="/vbook/ginger-man">The Ginger Man</a>, I felt ready to dive into a novel by James Joyce.
But none of his books are on my list of books to read for 2025 and I’m trying to get better at adhering to plans, so instead I started <em>Pachinko</em> by Min Jin Lee.
I also just finished <a id="2025-03-08-dominant-animal" class="" href="/vbook/the-dominant-animal"><em>The Dominant Animal</em></a> by Kathryn Scanlan, a remarkable little book of short stories that I’ve been reading very slowly for the last couple of years.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-severance--the-white-lotus">watching <em>Severance</em> &amp; <em>The White Lotus</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I watched the first few episodes of <em>Severance</em> months ago until I lost interest.
But now season two is coming out and many of my friends are talking about it so I resolved to catch up.
Rewatching it I feel again <a id="2025-03-08-severance" class="" href="/vbook/severance">underwhelmed</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I much prefer the approach that the writers of <em>The White Lotus</em> have been taking.
Instead of hinting cryptically at forthcoming drama and withholding it for several episodes, they start with a cast of characters with tensions already between and within them.
The potential is there from the beginning.
Throughout the season they build up the existing tensions and introduce new ones until eventually someone takes action or an incident triggers a chain of reactions.
Drama and plot flow naturally from interpersonal dynamics instead of dictating them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Severance</em> feels designed and implemented from the top down.
<em>The White Lotus</em> feels <a id="2024-08-12-tell-a-story-3" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-3">incubated</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="april">April</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 25 2025</em> –
This spring has been a turbulent time for me.
For several weeks issues of immigration and taxes have harried my mind mercilessly.
They are the kind of issues I wish I could banish from my life forever.
They are meaningless problems that threaten retaliation not by a person but by an amorphous, impersonal entity of brute force and unreckonable reach.
The task is not so much facing reality but placating a selfappointed arbiter of it.
To avoid these problems is to risk persecution from the world itself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Unlike interpersonal problems, these allow little opportunity for persuasion or compromise or compassion, unless a not-fully-dehumanized bureaucrat sneaks some in between the paperwork.
The main recourse is just that – paperwork.
For people in my situation that means hiring my own (expensive) functionaries to prepare papers that will please the faraway and faceless adversarial functionaries so that they in turn dissuade their armed counterparts from deploying violence on me.
But fear not!
For our underdog has been schooled in the art of reading instructions carefully and filling out answers dutifully even for questions absurd or irrelevant.
He knows how to deal in this horrible cypher of ink and paper to earn whatever prized document he needs to secure passage between manufactured realities and to live a life unhounded inside them.
Let’s not dwell on those not so well prepared or those of lesser means.</p></div>

<h3 id="may">May</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
May is the month the European soccer season climaxes.
Crowned are the winners of leagues and cups alike.
Arsenal, the team I support, are still in the running for two major honors: the English Premier League (EPL) and the UEFA Champions League.
Two days ago they defeated the reigning EPL champions by a whopping and unforeseeable 5-1 scoreline.
And yet our biggest competitor this season is not them, but Liverpool, who are six points ahead of us with a game in hand.
In early May, Arsenal will go to northern England and duel them at Anfield, Liverpool’s fortress.
<em>That</em> will probably be Arsenal’s biggest match of the season.
I start to feel a bit queasy thinking about it now, three months ahead.
It’s shocking how thrilling it is even from a thousand miles away to support a sports team embroiled in genuine competition.</p></div>

<h3 id="helping-my-self">helping my self</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The last couple months have been at times brutally stressful for me.
Issues of immigration and taxes have racked my mind and my body as well.
My eczema flared to the worst it has been in years.
Compulsive worrying postponed my sleep.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Playing soccer was a rare thing that relieved me of the heaviness of reality for good periods of time.
It is truly one of the joys of my life.
Contemplating it, my awe only grows as I notice all the things it gives me.
An opportunity to exercise and to play.
A healthy distraction from all my worries.
A way to commune with friends and strangers, out in nature.
All at the low low price of zero dollars.
On an ordinary day, it’s a beloved hobby.
In times of struggle, it’s like sustenance.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But soccer didn’t solve my problems.
I still had to do that.
And the most difficult part of that was stomaching the uncertainty and unpredictability of it all.
Along the way, I vented to friends and loved ones about my doubts and fears, but paramount to my emotional regulation during this turbulent period was a middleaged British journalist named Oliver Burkeman via his audiobook <a id="2025-06-01-meditations-for-mortals" class="" href="/vbook/meditations-for-mortals"><em>Meditations for Mortals</em></a>.
In a stoic yet cheerfully amused tone, his disembodied voice eased me out of my ceaseless fretting.
After I finished the book I began it again, eager for more of the reassurance his virtual presence gave me.
But it wasn’t just the tempering effect of Burkeman’s tone or the snappiness of his writing that alleviated my stress.
It was his shrewd insight on life’s problems and the exceedingly realistic stances he took on them.
I don’t care what people may say about Self Help.
It helps.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>June 24 2025</em> –
I had a moment last week when I realized I was finally out of the woods.
There are no longer any tax and immigration issues for me to address.
The tallest wave has come and gone and I’ve not drowned.
It sounds melodramatic but I was in physical pain for much of the spring.
The patch of excema that flared on my left hand appears on its way to recovery.
I can breathe a ragged sigh of relief.
I feel free to let my mind loose again.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, my most pressing concerns are meaningful ones.
Z and I have a London trip to plan.
And before that, perhaps also a small anniversary weekend away together.
And when July arrives, my focus will be on enjoying the two whole months of uninterrupted sunny weather we get in the PNW.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There’s also the question of where we will live next year.
It could be Seattle or New York if Z gets her long awaited green card, or it could be somewhere in Europe – the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany.
We’ll see.</p></div>

<!--more-->
One of the attributes of “<a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual books</a>” that most intrigues me is their <strong>dynamism</strong>, the fact that they can change over time.
It excites me not only for its practicality, but for the artistic possibilities it enables.
As I wrote originally in <em>The Virtual Book</em> and then reproduced in <a id="2022-06-11-show-instead-of-telling" class="" href="/vbook/show-instead-of-telling">one</a> of its separated pieces on this site:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this journal I intend to do something like the hypothetical memoirist.
Throughout the year, whenever I feel so inclined, I will write here about events that might happen, are happening, or have happened in 2025.
I think it will be interesting to juxtapose my expectations, experiences, and reflections throughout the year.
I hope it will neutralize the bias we typically grant hindsight, which is a privileged perspective but not a consummate one.</p></div>

The piece might be called <em>what I’m doing in my life</em> and it could be dense with references to other pieces, including this one.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 2 2025</em> –
Yesterday evening in our hotel room in Merida Z turned over to me and proposed a deal.
If we stay in Vancouver can we get a second dog?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before she met me, Z had a plan.
She would finish her degree, go to Indonesia for a few months, then move to Toronto.
But then we happened, and our single lives were suddenly compromised.
I spent an unplanned year in Victoria, then she spent a year commuting to Seattle to visit me.
After I got my green card, I started commuting with her part of the time.
A year later, we got her an apartment in Vancouver and started spending most of our time there.
Another year and a half later we swapped her apartment for a bigger one in a neighborhood in Vancouver that we love.
Years of adjustment and compromise have passed and we find ourselves living a life neither of us imagined but a happy one nonetheless.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All the while have endured Z’s intentions to venture out of the PNW.
And if our circumstances had made it feasible I believe we would have done it.
We might have moved to NYC if Z had been granted her green card.
We might have moved to Toronto or somewhere in Europe if it did not jeopardize my immigration status in the US.
We had no shortage of exciting ideas.
The latest one was to move somewhere for a year where Z could do a masters degree.
We considered places in Europe but then Z learned that studying in Canada would be more conducive to her career goals.
So that narrowed down the attractive options to Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the last few months Z has ruminated privately on what she wanted.
And finally she has determined, I think somewhat to her surprise, that she doesn’t want to move.
She wants to be home.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I have a similar feeling.
My appetite for novelty and change has been supplanted by a desire for steadiness and routine.
I like my job, I like my hobbies, I like my friends, I like my life.
I don’t feel like I need to go out and look for a new life.
I have a good one, and what I want most is to spend time in it.
I want to deepen, expand from within.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I have found trust that new experiences and new places are in our future.
No doubt parenthood will slow us down but it will also spring us into new adventures.
Perhaps we’ll take our kids to live in Mexico City for a year.
Perhaps Indonesia.
Who knows.
I’m looking forward to finding out.</p></div>

<h3 id="july">July</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Spring is springing and I’m already looking forward to paddleboard season.
Many of our friends in Seattle own paddleboards and we all go out on the lake regularly in July and August.
I expect this summer we will spend many more hours out on the water.
I’m also looking forward to Sports Days – afternoons we spend in the park playing volleyball and soccer, listening to music, snacking, and drinking cold beverages.
And a new tradition I anticipate will involve lots of leisurely communal outdoor time in the backyard of the house that my friend owns and a bunch of us live in.
It’s going to be great.</p></div>

<h3 id="plant-tending">plant tending</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Plant care for me is more chore than hobby, I am <a id="2025-06-09-use-restraint-2" class="" href="/vbook/restraint-2">tempted to say</a>.
But upon reflection in a better mood I notice that in the process of caring for my plants I experience many little moments of satisfaction and even awe.
One of my favorite things is noticing how my plants respond to my fulfilling their needs.
The day after I water them I see their perkiness restored and the firmness of their leaves replenished.
One day they sag helplessly, the next their posture rights as if with pride.
New offshoots appear and bud slowly until one day they are leaves fully unfurled.
With the enthusiasm some take water, others respond to the sun.
A wellwatered but withering plant moved to a brighter area suddenly sports a new sheen.</p></div>

<h3 id="goaltending">goaltending</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><a id="2024-07-07-now" class="" href="/vbook/now-5">One year ago</a> my interest in goalkeeping resurfaced.
I looked around for opportunities to play and considered even joining a new team exclusively as keeper.
But then in my first casual stint between the posts <a id="2024-09-30-now" class="" href="/vbook/now-6">I broke my finger</a>.
I still can’t fit my wedding band onto it, but it has long since recovered enough to allow my return to goalkeeping.
I feel like a kid again, diving left and right at shots my friends take from outside the box.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Part of the fun is trying to apply the techniques I see professional keepers use.
Their footwork I find hardest to emulate.
I suppose I am not fleetfooted in the outfield so it’s no surprise I am not a quick stepper as goaltender either.
It’s a crucial skill though.
It expands a goalie’s reach by bringing within diving distance the edges of the goal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In games, however, making saves is not so much a matter of diving heroically to stop a well placed shot.
It’s more so about forcing the opposition to place their shot well in order to score.
The primary task is to position yourself between your goal and the oncoming attackers to minimize their viable angles for scoring.
It’s an act of constant calibration that depends on how far away the attacker is and from what direction they are coming.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A common mistake I see made by goalkeepers in our rec league is that they stay near their goal line instead of approaching a shooter who is about to fire from a close distance.
The closer a shooter gets to the goal, the easier it is for them to score.
But when a shooter reaches a certain proximity to the goal, the goalie can make himself bigger by rushing towards the ball.
It’s a neat trick of geometry.
By shortening his distance to the ball, the goalie increases the number of shooting angles they cover.
As the goalie approaches, the shooter’s target shrinks.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
Last week, Z and I went paddleboarding for the first and I’m afraid perhaps the only time this year.
We bought paddleboards in August of 2022 and have been enjoying them every summer in Seattle since then.
For two and a half years, I had an apartment in Capitol Hill, a six minute drive up the incline from Lake Union.
At some point, we discovered Terry Petus Park, a lovely little lakeside spot tucked beside the houseboat neighborhood in Eastlake.
In the summers, we’d go down there with friends and launch into Lake Union from the treeshaded dock and spend a few hours out on the water chatting, drinking, and listening to music.
Even our little dog Baxter – wearing his little life jacket adorned with a foam shark fin – came out on the paddleboards with us.
Whenever friends or family visited in the summer we brought them with us.
My older sister absolutely loved it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In late 2024, I moved into my friend’s house in West Seattle, and nowadays Z and I spend more time in Vancouver.
We haven’t tried paddleboarding in Vancouver yet, but we expect it to be less convenient.
There is far less access to lakes than in Seattle, where it is abundant.
The biggest problem, however, is that Z and I are going to the UK for most of August.
Come September the warmth will evaporate rather quickly.
Oh well.
You can’t have it all.</p></div>

<h3 id="august">August</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Some friends and I are thinking of taking a trip to the San Juan Islands or to some other natural destination in the region.
If indeed we do so in August it may coincide with some of our birthdays.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
Z and I have booked a trip to England and Ireland.
We’re going to Dublin, County Clare, County Kerry, Bristol, &amp; London.
We also intend to visit Bath and Cornwall.
It’s going to be great.
In London, we are going to attend Arsenal vs Leeds.
I’ve never attended an Arsenal match.
Watching them play a Premier League game at the Emirates Stadium will be a dream come true.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-circe-and-other-books">reading <em>Circe</em> and other books</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last night on the bus from Seattle to Vancouver I read the last fifty five pages of <em>Circe</em>.
It finished strong, a feat I deem greater than starting well.
The start is a place of possibility, an opening.
There are yet so many worthy ways to go.
But at the close, the author can deliver us to one place only.
In ending <em>Circe</em> Miller excelled.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the side I’m reading <em>How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One</em> by Stanley Fish.
My friend J recommended it when I texted him (like I did several other friends) two sentences and asked him which he preferred.
I did so to test the ideas I wrote about in <a id="2025-07-11-revise-a-sentence-5" class="" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-5"><em>how to revise a sentence #5</em></a>, in which I took sentences from <em>Circe</em> and tried to improve them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m also listening to <em>Is A River Alive?</em> by Robert Macfarlane after I heard him speak so eloquently about writing in <a href="https://youtu.be/rdsE9XqB2bI?si=sQtRneBdN7A-lVA5">this interview</a>.
He is the latest addition to the list of writers I admire.</p></div>

<h3 id="thriving-in-islands-of-time">thriving in islands of time</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bus trips and ferry rides and even international flights have turned out to be times well suited for me to read and write.

</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I hope to spend a good deal of time reading and writing while traveling to Dublin, to Bristol, to London, and then back to Vancouver.
We leave tomorrow, to explore the Irish countryside and the urban hubs of England.
I’m thrilled to say we got tickets to Arsenal’s first home match of the new English Premier League season.
If I had a bucket list, attending a competitive game at the Emirates would be on it.
And by the end of this month, that item would be checked off.</p></div>

<h3 id="enjoying-the-summer">enjoying the summer</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve unfortunately only paddleboarded once this summer but I’ve played plenty of soccer and golf, even a game of tennis.
I somewhat regret that we will travel most of August, it’ll eat up so much of the warm and sunny weather we get in our corner of the world.</p></div>

<h3 id="planning-a-xmas-trip-to-mexico">planning a Xmas trip to Mexico</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December we will escape the dull grey PNW for lovely, sunny Yucatan.
I’ve never been yet and I’m so excited to go.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-curb-your-enthusiasm-and-portlandia">watching <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> and <em>Portlandia</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z likes to compare me to Larry.
Like when he declined to roll up his long sleeve so that the dentist could give him a shot because he didn’t want to ruin the elasticity of the cuff.
She’s right, I agree with Larry.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It had been years since I’d watched <em>Portlandia</em>.
But I’ve been thinking about it recently.
More than ten years ago the show stoked in me an interest in cities like Portland that has grown into my enthusiasm today for good urbanism.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-dogtooth-and-thinking-still-about-severance">watching <em>Dogtooth</em> and thinking still about <em>Severance</em>
</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The first movie Z names when she gets into a conversation about indie or arthouse films is <em>Dogtooth</em> by Yorgos Lanthimos.
I finally watched it and it reminded me of the show <em>Severance</em>, which I think <a id="2025-03-08-severance" class="" href="/vbook/severance">fails</a> where <em>Dogtooth</em> succeeds.
I’ve made the comparison to a few people and they’ve surprised me with their puzzlement.
I suppose it’s not an intuitive matchup, or at least not an obvious one.
But I think their premises are similar in meaningful ways.</p></div>

<h3 id="thinking-of-starting-a-new-writing-project">thinking of starting a new writing project</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z suggested to me a few weeks ago that I write on Substack to engage with readers.
She knows I love to share what I write and discuss it because I do it with her all the time.
Often on our dates I give her my phone with the browser open to my latest piece and she reads it in silence in front of me.
When she <em>Hmms</em> and nods I say <em>What?</em>
I want to know what made her react and what the reaction is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>What I write on this site concerns many topics and takes various forms — blog, journal, essay, app, notes.
It’s hard to imagine strangers subscribing.
To attract and maintain the interest of an anonymous public however small I figure I’d have to offer a coherent and focused stream of content.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>What if I write about <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal</a>?
Like other fans I spend a good deal of my time and energy thinking, talking, even analyzing the activity of this football club.
There are of course already many Arsenal content creators making videos and podcasts.
But how many people are writing?
Maybe no one wants to read about it.
But reading about their favorite football club may in fact serve as good runway for men who want to read more but haven’t gotten the habit going.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I have come to a hilltop in the undulating journey of our lives and have now in sight a vast plateau, a fertile and stable ground where we will set down for a while to found and grow a family.
To that place, from our position now, we measure the last length of our youth – if that indeed it can still be called – an evershrinking space to roam carelessly before care becomes our primary occupation.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our trip to Ireland has widened our eyes, shown us what we’ve been missing by aiming our travels at cities foremost and the time we’ve been wasting not spent exploring the landscapes of British Columbia.

<div class="paragraph"><p>It surprised me how small the city feels.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Dublin feels bigger today.
It’s the weekend and this afternoon there was a friendly game between Leeds United and AC Milan so the streets are chock full of people, many in yellow and white Leeds jerseys and a few Rossoneri sprinkled about.
The city center is swarming with pedestrians, pubs brimming with cheerful drinkers pooling on the sidewalks by the entrance.
Out the windows the sound of live music streams laced with singalongers.
Cars rumble and buses whine and bike bells chime on the street.
Sunshine stretches out on the asphalt and above it lights up the translucent flags that hang angled from building fronts.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At the Jameson Distillery, our host was the most animated one we’ve had in Dublin.
He waved his arms wildly and in husky bellows rattled off his lines, punctuating them with dual finger snaps and tossing of the Jameson bottle from one hand to the other, the glass clinking against his hand jewelry.
He concluded his opening speech by ramming the bottle down onto a prop book, then as if waking from a trance he commented mildly and mostly to himself that this bottle hadn’t broken.
I too was surprised.</p></div>

A positive definition instead of a negative one.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before we settled on Bristol, Z and I considered visiting Liverpool.
When I noticed that Wrexham was nearby, I fancied a day trip down to see them play their first ever(?) Championship match at the Racecourse, or at least to grab a pint at The Turf and meet Wayne, the charming bar owner and Wrexham A.F.C. devotee.
I just realized he reminds me of Karl Pilkington.
Agh, I’m almost regretting not pursuing this plan.
Commute from Bristol to Wrexham would be long and I can’t imagine tickets would be cheap to get, if any were available at all.
I suppose it might still be worth it if I can watch the game at The Turf.
We’ll see.
Z won’t be thrilled with the idea, but the 16th is my birthday and for it she’ll do whatever possible to make me happy.
I’m a lucky guy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our <a id="2025-08-07-ireland-trip" class="" href="/vbook/ireland">time in the Irish countryside</a> was fantastic.
There we found the conventional tourist attractions well worth seeing.
It is making me reflect on cities and what about them makes them worth visiting.
Good food of diverse types.
Art shows like galleries, live music, and stand up comedy.
Historical landmarks and notable architecture.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A remarkable aspect of a good city is its density.
I think I have to shift my mindset.
Here it isn’t about covering ground but about drilling down in single spots.
Spending hours at a museum.
Eating a great dinner in a restaurant mere steps from another where you had breakfast.
Even returning to the same restaurant to try different items on the menu.
Doing these things feel less like exploring and adventuring.</p></div>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I can’t help but chuckle to myself sitting here on my first train trip in England.
The platform was occupied with travelers waiting for the train and when it arrived everyone flocked to the carriage entrances.
Z and I were confused to see everyone standing so close to the doors before they opened.
Wouldn’t there be people on the train already, some of whom would be disembarking here in Bristol?
Indeed there were.
The doors opened and people started trickling out, many with luggage and one with a stroller and yet the travelers waiting to board barely made way for them.
Z and I looked at each other.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Once we got on the train, we waited for people in front of us to stow luggage and find seats.
The seats were mostly occupied but we saw a few single open seats remaining so we stepped down the aisle towards them.
Nearest us there appeared to be two single seats open at either side of the aisle but when I came to what would be mine I discovered a small dog panting where he lay before a bowl of water.
I considered asking for the seat but then there were more open seats down the aisle.
Still it felt funny to give deference to a dog.
I turned to the other side of the aisle and asked the girl if she’d mind moving her luggage from the seat next to her.
To my and Z’s surprise she replied that she did mind, that she had documents in her suitcase.
I said <em>Oh, you can’t put it there?</em> pointing overhead.
She said <em>No, it doesn’t fit.</em>
Two dreadful excuses.
Z and I looked at each other again, mutual incredulity growing.
No matter, ahead were more open seats.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A woman with a baby strapped to her chest asked me for help putting her stroller in the overhead compartment.
I did and as she turned to get in her seat the backpack on her back touched the face of a middleaged man sitting across the aisle and he moaned and clutched his nose as if he’d been struck.
The mother turned to him and said <em>I’m so sorry, are you ok?</em> with all the polite concern in her tone of voice but none much on her face.
The man didn’t look at her anyway — he was still holding his face — and he waved her away and said <em>Just sit down</em>.
The mother exchanged silent looks with us and sat down.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As Z and I lurched down the aisle of the moving train towards the few remaining empty seats, nobody made to remove their bags from their adjacent seat to allow us it.
Each of us had to walk up to a passenger, look them in the face, and ask that they make their spare seat available to us.
An opportunity to interact more with the locals I suppose.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>I started buying houseplants about four years ago.
<!--more-->
No research went into it, I just picked two that I liked from the grocery store and brought them home.
This proved fatal for one of them.
I think I overwatered it.
Or maybe it got infested by malevolent insects.
I don’t know.
I didn’t try very hard to save it.
I wanted my apartment to have that leafy, green look but I didn’t want to sink time and effort into making it happen.
I wanted the reward, but not the work.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Apart from that early casualty, however, my approach of low involvement has worked pretty well.
The other plant – a lemon-lime dracaena – has lived and thrived in the years since I brought it home.
Multiple times I’ve repotted it and today it stands at two or three times its original height.
I’m proud of it, somewhat.
Several of its leaves are at their edges browned with decay due to some reason I’ve neglected to investigate.
Nonetheless, it lives on.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Every now and then I get the motivation to watch YouTube videos to learn how to perform certain tasks of plant care.
The people who make these videos tend to chat at the camera for a while, stroking and poking their plants as they slowly approach the subject at hand.
I watch these videos impatiently, jumping forward with irritation until I find the bits of information I need.
I want to get the task done as quickly as possible.
Plant care for me is more chore than hobby.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s a funny thing to find yourself resenting chores you created for yourself.
Nobody and no thing require that I have plants in my home and yet I have several.
Five in the bedroom, one in the living room, three in the kitchen, one in the bathroom, and seven in the office.
Many of these are second or third generation houseplants that I planted from snippings I trimmed and propagated in water.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I stopped buying plants a while ago and yet I keep accumulating more of them.
The list above is almost twenty in number without including my biggest and oldest plants, which are back in my apartment in Seattle, 238km away.
Over there I have my lemon-lime dracaena, a sizeable monstera, a growing ficus, a tentacled pothos, and several other smaller plants.
The better job I do at caring for my plants, the longer they live, the bigger they get, and the greater my responsibilities become.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Watering plants is a surprisingly effortful task, especially when you water them all on the same day.
For some, I stand on tiptoes and extend my arm rigidly overhead to let a stream of water arc into the pot.
For others, I do a mini deadlift and lug their fragile figures to the tub.
Any spills I mop up on my hands and knees.
A long way from lounging on the couch and enjoying my living room.
Sometimes, I feel that the work their upkeep demands has surpassed the pleasure they give me.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For a long time I accumulated plants and grew them with the aim of making my living room lush with green leaves.
Eventually, I realized the vision.
And I loved it.
But, as is often the case, the happily ever after is a lot more tedious than its still image suggests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am living a strange life.
It isn’t one I dreamed up for myself, but one that has developed bit by bit over the years from my circumstances and how I’ve chosen to adapt to them.
Enviously I’ve held onto everything in my grasp and years later I find myself sprawled across two countries, in two apartments, both full of houseplants.
This abundance has enriched my life and encumbered it as well.
Perhaps it’s time to lighten the burdens I’ve put upon myself.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/restraint-2" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
Ideally I would have done it in the spring so that they’d flourish during their natural season of growth but I put it off, feeling too encumbered mentally and emotionally by immigration and tax paperwork I had to do.
I despaired for weeks and found myself yearning for a simpler life established in a single place where my presence is never in question and where my household chores feel under control.
But I have since come out of that period of distress and done so without making any sacrifices or compromises, though it would be wise to make some now while life feels manageable.
I dread that another similar period of adversity will come, and then I realize no doubt it will.
To be sure some sources of worry and anguish I will eliminate or neutralize but then new ones will spring up in due time.
One cannot live without risk, cannot have anything without the threat of loss and the burden of maintaining it.
And the greater the blessing bestowed, the greater the fear to lose it imposed.
There is no hope to banish suffering and to live.
But there is courage to face it, composure to remain steady, judiciousness to know which gifts are worth accepting, and restraint to denounce the ones that encumber more than they enrich.</p></div>

<h3 id="september">September</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Paul Thomas Anderson’s new movie comes out in September.
He is one of my favorite directors and film writers.
I really enjoyed <em>Licorice Pizza</em> in theatres and <em>There Will Be Blood</em> is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen.
I have multiple friends who would also be excited to see his newest work in theatres.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>September 8 2025</em> –
September has begun dusty, gray, and ugly in our part of the world.
The smoke of notso distant forest fires dulls the sky into a hazy lifeless blue and the sunlight into an unnatural orange.
For me September usually induces nostalgia.
The month of bittersweet transition from untethered joy of summer to the cool and quiet comforts of fall.
A return to routine and predictability.</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>Doing laundry, swapping chores, and reformulating “attention ecologies.”
<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="doing-laundry">doing laundry</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At the Catholic high school I attended there was a family of six children whose mother was a devout Christian and would bless each one of them as she folded their clean laundry.
I am not religious, but do find that <a id="2025-09-10-think-with-your-body" class="" href="/vbook/think-with-your-body-2">doing laundry is like a ritual</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="swapping-chores">swapping chores</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>When I am a parent perhaps the responsibility of family laundry will fall on me.
The ideal way to divvy up chores is to assign each to whomever is naturally motivated to do them.
Recently I took up the responsibility of filling the dishwasher because piles of dirty dishes bothered me so much.
When it was Z’s responsibility, I would fret about when it would get done.
Not because she procastinated excessively but because I had little control over it.
The reverse was true about vacuuming the apartment.
Z would stress about the dust and hairs settling along the walls of our apartment and periodically she would complain that I didn’t vacuum enough.
Finally I realized how foolish we were being and we swapped chores.</p></div>

<h3 id="reformulating-attention-ecologies">reformulating “attention ecologies”</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While hanging up my laundry, I finally found a crisper way of thinking about <a id="2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention" class="" href="/vbook/attention">ecologies of attention</a> and how they work.
We consider our character and our attitude to be determinants of our behavior and overlook the influence of our physical and cultural environments.
Environments matter because they dictate what we perceive, what and whom we interact with, and how we interact.
Through those means they influence what we pay attention to and by extension what we care about.
There is a loop here involving perception, attention, interaction, and values.

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>September 16 2025</em> –
I have several friends who work at Microsoft as I do and a few months ago one of them said he’s seen “too many surveys” broadcasted internally about our company’s flexible work policy and that he suspected that the company was preparing to retract permission allowing employees to work from home.
I had no such inkling.
Five years had already passed since Covid had established the norm of working remotely and while other tech giants like Amazon and Google had enforced a partial return to office in 2023, Microsoft had maintained its flexible work policy.
It seemed silly to think Microsoft might change their policy now, two years later.
I figured my friend was being paranoid or defensively pessimistic, but a few weeks later I asked my manager’s manager about it and he confirmed that our EVP had recently indicated that an update to the company’s flexible work was incoming.
Gulp.
So after five and a half years of working remotely, I face the prospect of resuming regular commute to a suburban corporate campus and losing the comforts and conveniences of working from my own home.
The company is willing to make exceptions for certain reasons but not due to my personal work preferences, even if though my performance has consistently exceeded expectations.
I am assured that survey data indicates I will Thrive More and Deliver Greater Business Impact by collaborating with my peers in person.</p></div>

<h3 id="gearing-down">gearing down</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I find myself coming down a wave of energy, waning in my motivation for work after a multiweek surge to solve various technical challenges.
I have learned a lot and shed insight into heretofore unknown problems in our system, but I still haven’t solved the main problem.
Week after week I resumed work with appetite and drive, but now I feel a bit deflated and tired.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am consciously riding this ebb in energy without panicking or chastising myself because I know it’s part of my natural rhythm.
In the past I’ve responded with worry and guilt, which have only drained me further.
This time I’m trying to adapt to it instead of resisting or rejecting it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead of responding reactively by hounding myself to keep up the pace or reacting avoidantly by procrastinating work in general, I am trying to respond with composure.
I am allowing the intensity of my workrate to subside without letting it stall.
To do so I am allowing myself the small periods of rest as I need them so that I can continue making incremental progress without overdrawing from my energy reserves.
I am letting my mind wander and indulging my curiosity so that motion can result naturally from unforced motivation.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Maybe I’ll <a id="2025-09-23-come-up-with-ideas" class="" href="/vbook/come-up-with-ideas-3">start a nonprofit futsal league</a> in my neighborhood.
Or not.
I don’t have to.
Regardless, such daydreams generate a mild excitement that serves as cheap fuel to carry me forward and prevent my stagnation.
Better to maintain modest momentum than let things come to standstill until I can muster a jolt to start again.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>September 25 2025</em> –
Here in the coastal cities of the PNW, before October arrives and the sunsets begin encroaching on our afternoons and the familiar gray blanket unrolls over the daytime sky, we have September.
A brief period of balance, of cool air and sunshine, of leafy trees and soft crunchy sidewalks.
An easing from the hectic activity of summertime and a brief refuge from holidays that demand shopping, planning, traveling, socializing, all in very particular modes.
It might be my favorite month of the year.
And yet it depends on the others for contrast because twelve Septembers would be too many.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>October 7 2025</em> –
The first rains of September fell modestly and seldom so I went about my business as if summer went on as well.
On a sunny Saturday afternoon I strapped my pitching wedge and putter onto the frame of my bike in a way that seemed to me clever and economical and I set out on my usual path towards the center of town.
I rode onto the main road and down its gentle slope.
As I came to the stoplight it changed in my favor.
No traffic headed in my direction.
I cruised into the intersection with my left arm raised to signal and arced my path slowly to the left until my backtire slid out from beneath me and I crashed onto the asphalt.
From every direction alarmed pedestrians called out <em>Are you ok?</em> and as I got up and collected my bike I assured each one that I was.
I pushed my bike out of the road and to confirm I was indeed ok a guy my age approached me in that crouching posture people assume to offer help to stricken strangers.
After I confirmed I was ok he nodded and lowered his outstretched palm and straightened back up as he turned away.</p></div>

<h3 id="october">October</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
I saw somebody wearing a motorcycle helmet adorned with big furry rabbit ears and it reminded me of <em>Donnie Darko</em>.
I watched it for the first time in the summer of 2023 and I want to watch it again.
It occurred to me that I should host a series of spooky movie viewings in October.
We could watch one per week and let friends know ahead of time so they have it in their plans for October.
I’d probably show a David Lynch film, too.</p></div>

<h3 id="november">November</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
Thanksgiving is a big holiday in the US.
I get the Thursday and Friday off.
Last year I thought about going to Mexico City to visit my grandparents, but didn’t end up doing it.</p></div>

<h3 id="reflecting-on-the-year">reflecting on the year</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2025 I <a id="2025-12-15-2025-retro" class="" href="/vbook/2025-3">did several things</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I began the year with several intentions.</p></div>
<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Do big things at work.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Get fitter.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Lose twenty pounds.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Have more discussions with friends.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Read copiously.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Keep writing for and developing this site.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Nurture friendships.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Heal and grow.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Enjoy our DINK status.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Ruminate on longterm plans.</li>
</ol>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To foster continuous, incremental progress on those intentions I translated them into daily goals: work, exercise, read, write, enjoy, grow, discuss, socialize, and plan.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m happy with the progress I made on #1, #4, #6, #7, and #10.
I think I may have made progress on #2, but I didn’t measure it.
I didn’t accomplish #3.
But at my annual medical my doctor commended me for my progress over the last two years.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On #5 I did decently.
I read eight of the fourteen books I set out to read.
On top of that I read an extra four books and listened to a fifth.
Of the original fourteen I read part of two and <a id="2020-01-12-ditch-books" class="" href="/vbook/ditch-books">ditched</a> them.
Every now and then I read articles in the New Yorker.
I definitely feel I have a healthy reading endurance.
The “copious” part of the goal didn’t come easily to me.
I read in bouts.
I don’t like forcing myself to read when I’m not in <a id="2023-11-30-chart-moods" class="" href="/vbook/chart-moods">the mood</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m not sure how to evaluate my progress on #8 yet.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On #9 Z and I did the basics.
Sleep in.
Play video games.
Golf.
See our friends all the time.
Spend long, quiet weekends lounging and doing as we please.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2025</em> –
In the spirit of living with forethought and premeditation, I suggested to my mom that we begin planning a post-Christmas trip to Mexico or Honduras, somewhere warm.
In years past I’ve intended to buy flights for the holiday season months in advance but never managed it.
Hopefully this year.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>April 1 2025</em> –
Z began learning to snowboard this season and has been slowing buying her own gear.
The current season is winding down now but I look forward to the next one.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>July 20 2025</em> –
On condition that we go to Indonesia in the spring of 2026 to see her maternal family, Z has agreed to visit Mexico for Christmas of this year.
I’m excited to explore the Yucatan peninsula, a part of Mexico I’ve never seen.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>December 15 2025</em> —
We are sitting here at baggage carousel 8 my mom and I and she tells me that coming to Mexico for Christmas was my idea.
This surprises me.
Then I remember about this piece and I open it on my browser and show my mom, she was right.</p></div>

  <li>go in hot tub with my mom and drink a beer</li>
  <li>rest in room; shower; do digital chores</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m impressed by the Tren Maya.
Not by how well it works but by the mere fact it exists.
It’s not the kind of thing I would expect to see in Mexico.
Admittedly, it’s no bullet train.
From Cancun to Tulum it takes an hour forty, the same travel time by car.
And it only runs a few times per day.
But it only opened last year and it connects the Mexican southeast.
We’ve mentioned it to servers, cab drivers, desk clerks, but no one we’ve spoken to has taken it.
On this one today there are a few dozen passengers but what strikes me is the number of workers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To enter the platform, we show our printed tickets and identification before progressing to automated gates where a lady instructs us to scan our QR code in the typical place at the front of the gate.
It beeps and opens to let us through.
A step past it on the other side another lady motions us forward toward the metal detector a few feet away and tells us to line up on the right side.
Four or five uniformed officers stand at the one metal detector, feeding in bags and baskets into it on the conveyor belt on one side and taking them off on the other side.
Once seated on the train a man comes down the aisle asking for tickets but when I mutter I don’t know where I put it he just confirms our destination before continuing down the aisle.
At each station we pass uniformed officers of the <em>Guardia Nacional</em> stand and traipse around while several cleaning ladies sweep and mop already tidylooking floors.</p></div>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This morning when we came out onto the train platform a worker greeted us and queried about our assigned train car.
We told him and he led us to a particular spot on the platform marked with yellow and black tape to which our car would align when the train arrived.
Already I thought this was unnecessary information but then to my surprise he explained a few more things.
Please stay behind the yellow line, when the train arrives let passengers get off before boarding, and please bear in mind while doing so that there will be a gap between the station and the train, and if you happen to drop a belonging into it do no try to retrieve it – be it a cellphone, a bag, a pair of sunglasses – do no try to retrieve it, that’s what we are here for, we will retrieve it for you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I was very amused by our Uber driver.
His straightfaced, irreverent demeanor reminded me of one of my Dad’s best friends.
<em>They’ve been closing streets every Sunday</em> he said.
<em>Anything to make traffic worse.</em>
We went in one direction and then another and then another, in search of a way out of the city.
We came to an empty intersection where a policeman stood wearing a high visibility vest and holding a whistle in his mouth.
I suggested we ask him for directions to the airport.
Our driver said nothing to me but rolled down the window and asked the policeman, <em>Y para el aeropuerto?</em>
The policeman had no idea.
He muttered apologetically, maybe this way, maybe that way.
As we drove away our driver remarked with no change in expression that we may as well have asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantinflas">Cantinflas</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="vacationing-in-the-yucatan-peninsula">vacationing in the Yucatan Peninsula</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m in Mexico with my wife Z and my mom and my younger sister.
We’re visiting a few places <a id="2025-12-16-yucatan" class="" href="/vbook/yucatan">in the Yucatan Peninsula</a>.
It’s beautiful and warm here.
Tourism seems to be by far the largest industry in this region.
It’s not surprising but it is saddening to think that people’s livelihood relies so heavily on it.
Everywhere we’ve gone we’ve been told that 2025 has been a bad year.</p></div>

<h3 id="working-on-this-site">working on this site</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Idle time at hotels and on the train has given me ample opportunity to think and to write.
I’m glad to have ended my writing dryspell of several weeks.
Beyond that, I’m excited about a new idea I have for reworking a fundamental aspect of this site.
The idea is to generalize the format I created for my piece <a id="2025-05-18-kinds-of-books" class="" href="/vbook/kinds-of-books"><em>kinds of books</em></a> so that it can be used by other pieces.
Today, I applied the format to a second piece, <a id="2025-12-15-2025-retro" class="" href="/vbook/2025-3"><em>2025 in retrospect</em></a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m calling this format <em>stacks</em>.
The basic idea is to format prose within a single piece into multiple separate lines of thought instead of a single linear flow.
Because the reader must click on a stack to see the prose it contains, their curiosity dictates what they read, they pursue instead of following.
This pattern abides by the <strong>nonlinear</strong> and <strong>readerdriven</strong> attributes of my “<a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a>” idea.
(That piece itself would likely benefit from being reformatted into <em>stacks</em>.
I think the same for <a id="2023-11-15-bookmarks" class="" href="/vbook/bookmarks"><em>bookmarks</em></a> and <a id="2025-03-05-features-on-this-site" class="" href="/vbook/what-5"><em>what is this site? #5</em></a>.)
It excites me because it’s a simple way to explore and experiment with my ideas regarding nontraditional mediums for reading and writing.</p></div>

<h3 id="coming-up-with-ideas">coming up with ideas</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Gazing out over the Lagoon of Bacalar, listening to palm trees sway in the tropical breeze, my mind turns over projects I might work on.
Starting a free futsal league in my neighborhood.
Starting a YouTube channel to analyze movies like <em>The Mask</em> for their latent ideologies and unconscious messaging.
Starting a Twitch stream or a YouTube channel or a podcast to discuss and inform Vancouverites on the upcoming city election.
Researching and writing a virtual book recounting the stories of my maternal family lineage and contemplating my Mexican identity.</p></div>
