        <div class="paragraph"><p>Highly recommend to anyone interested in reading about time management.
This book has a radical message for you: give up hope.

You’re never going to finish.
Relearn what it means to spend your time well.
You have very little of it and your anxiety about not wasting it is founded on bad assumptions and impossible standards.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’d rate this book higher if I had learned more from it.
I’ve thought lots about time management.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes I feel like Burkeman allows himself doubtful claims, but his ideas are interesting and useful nonetheless.
His writing is good, but </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/coordinate-metaphors">not great</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoyed his anecdotes and references to other works.
The idea of pre-clock life blew my mind.
I hadn’t thought about the relationship between clocks, time, industrialization, and wage-labor.
A great example of fundamental paradigms we don’t question.
Pure ideology!</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>It is old advice to live now because now is the only time you will ever live.
Embrace this moment because it is the only one in reach.

But the advice resonates only so deeply with me.
I find many nows made for trading, worthy of giving up for what I can get later.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this cliche </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/four-thousand-weeks">Oliver Burkeman</a><p> adds a darker harmony with a note of his own.
You will never make the most of your time.
It is painfully short and any bid for optimal use of it is doomed.
Suddenly the original cliche is not about changing your attitude but about accepting that you get what you get.
The task is not to settle, but to admit defeat.
Time rules you and the freest you can get is by giving up the fight.</p>

      </div>
    </div></div><p> to achieve even a fraction of the things we propose to do.
Burkeman’s mention of mortality in the naming of his books is not an empty gesture or a marketing gambit.
His writings on the topic of time-management and day-to-day living take death out of the subtext and put it where it belongs, in the text itself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This book offers a series of cleverly angled perspectives that transform problems by considering them differently.
Each chapter begins with a quote and Chapter Three begins with a brilliant one from Sheldon Bernard Kopp:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>You are free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is not a fantasy of omnipotence, but an energizing reminder of the control you <em>do</em> have.
Reframing my role in this way – from unwilling object to autonomous subject – freed me from the futile and exhausting cycle of resent towards my circumstances and refocused my attention on what I was doing about them.
As Burkeman phrases it:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>[Sometimes you’ll] do the undesirable thing because you understand the cost and you <em>don’t</em> want to incur it. Notice how different that is, how different it feels from grudgingly saying yes because you feel you have no choice, then resenting it for days.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In short, there are two options.
Do nothing and accept the consequences, or do what you can to get the result you want.
Idle rage makes no sense.
If the consequences are unacceptable then do something about them.
If they are acceptable, accept them and move on.
This directive prompts another liberating insight:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Most of the potential consequences we find ourselves agonizing about don’t remotely justify such angst.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This also helped me enormously.
It simplified my conundrum by helping me realize that my primary task was to eliminate risk of actual harm befalling me and reducing the likelihood of costly consequences.
That done, as long as I can fiscally, emotionally, and physically afford the potential consequences, there is no reason to worry like I am in danger.</p></div>
