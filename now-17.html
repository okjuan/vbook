Ironically, I put little thought into it. Most the list I chose arbitrarily from the dozens of books I own but have not read. I made a list not because I wanted to focus on particular themes, styles, or topics but because I wanted to challenge myself to stick to a plan and to read copiously.\n\nWhat I discovered is that my reading throughput increases if I allow certain kinds of books into the mix. In the spring there was a period when I read more because I was reading two books in parallel, &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;. Emotionally neither book is light but in &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; the writing is simple and grounded and the story is straightforward and swift. When I had time to read but picking up &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt; felt like a task, it was easy to fan open &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt; instead. In the afternoons and early evenings when the weather was nice enough I went out into the neighborhood with both books in my bag and by the time I found a seat I knew which one better suited my appetite.\n"}]'>

As I like to do when friends see my home for the first time I gave the newcomers a quick tour. At one point I mentioned that I never used the clawfoot bathtub and one of my friends remarked that I didn't know what I was missing.\n\nSo I tried it and now I know what I'm not missing. It's a great option when I come home tired and sweaty from a soccer game. I don't have to wait until after I shower to rest, I can do it &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; I bathe. I lounge in there for a while, drinking a cold beverage and watching YouTube on my laptop. On weekends sometimes I'll read in the bath by the light of the window.\n&quot;}]">

A couple months ago, Cineplex announced that The Park Theatre in Vancouver – the only cinema for hundreds of kilometers in any direction that projects 120mm film – would be closed permanently. Public outcry culminated in the theatre's rescue by the likes of Sean Baker and other notable names in contemporary film and TV, one of Vancouver's major industries. (Most recently I discovered Cinematheque in downtown Vancouver, a nonprofit theatre that shows international and independent films.) I'm heartened that management at the Rio Theatre, another beloved local venue, will be taking over operation of The Park. It remains to be seen whether the 120mm film projector will survive the transition.&quot;}]">

It's a beautiful and strange place – a remote seaside colony where avid surfers who have come from the Commonwealth at large labor for the leisures of wealthy soujourners in exchange for an idyllic stint on the raw edge of the Pacific. They work as baristas, servers, cooks, surf instructors, and they're all quite happy. No doubt for most this is a temporary situation. I imagine they live in blissful awareness of a fleeting golden period, a time of very little responsibility and immense immediate freedom. Whatever serious pursuit they may have abandoned or postponed to come here can wait because they have time on their side and joy today.&quot;}]">

I agree that public services and infrastructure need to scale with the city's growth but I am optimistic about the city's ability and willingness to accomplish that. There is plenty of evidence of it.\n\nThe city is building a brand new subway line connecting the hearts of East and West Vancouver and were it not for the selfish NIMBYism of wealthy West Vancouverites it might've extended all the way to the University of British Columbia on the far western edge. In coordination with the construction of this new subway and in keeping with the province's Transit Oriented Development (TOA) designation, the city has stipulated minimum building heights and target proportions of affordable housing among other criteria.\n\nBeyond this major project, which is called The Broadway Plan, the city has identified particular neighborhoods that show potential to develop into lively practical urban nodes of the kind that exist elsewhere already. The city is changing, and not only do the underlying motivations seem positive and progressive but so does the planning seem competent and ambitious.\n&quot;}]">

Access is granted by fares paid in the currency of paperwork – exams, resumes, applications, appeals, tickets. It sounds silly and trivial until you see reality itself change shape in one way and neglect to do so in another way in attempts to adhere to bureacracatic decree.\n\nWatching meetings of the Vancouver City Council has opened my eyes to the immense power at play in city politics. Boring and dry as the meetings may be, they play an influential role in shaping material reality. Normally, meetings and bureaucratic processes stultify me, but in this case I feel galvanized. I see an intelligible process of consequence and one in which I could participate.\n"}]'>

I play egularly and I've noticed my body's readiness to perform varies substantially. I want to play well regularly so I suppose I should learn to manage the determinants of my body state. I expect they are fairly obvious: sleep, hydration, diet, and fitness.\n\nFor a few months now I've wanted to delve into the topic of hydration. What I know I've learned from two main sources. One is conventional wisdom – you need not just water but electrolytes, for example – and the other is selfobservation. From the latter I've noticed I crave foods like soup and certain vegetables when I'm not just hungry but thirsty. All these thoughts culminated in a realization after I enjoyed a dumpling soup at a sushi restaurant – I should try making this at home.\n&quot;}]">

More than ten years ago my friend Jon started customizing his clothes. Hemming pants, adding patches, and even cobbling together new articles from several thrifted pieces. One day he gave me a pair of jeans he'd assembled from three others. They were roomy at the top and tapered at the bottom, exactly the kind I wanted. They didn't fit him well but they suited me perfectly.\n\nZ has a sewing machine that her grandmother gifted her and she has regularly encouraged me to try my hand at it. She knows I'm interested and whenever the opportunity arises to shirk restrictions on activities and behaviors based on gender she promotes it. So on a statutory holiday I finally did. It took me a couple hours of watching and rewatching YouTube videos and cursing the thread's disinterest in passing through the eye of the needle but finally I got the machine to do my will. I mended the seam of an old pair of soccer shorts, a pair I love.\n&quot;}]">

        <div class="paragraph"><p>Starting a new book is exciting.
<!--more-->
It’s like putting on a brand new pair of shoes on a sunny morning, with no puddles in sight.
Sadly, the novelty wears off.
Then, there’s that uncomfortable feeling at the prospect of leaving the book unfinished.
The same book that starts as an exciting little activity becomes a nagging reminder that you failed to reach a goal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nobody likes starting a book and failing to finish it.
So much so, I suspect, that it discourages us from starting a new one, in fear of not reaching the end.
After all, who signs up for a marathon that they don’t expect to finish? Even if you ran an impressive 20 miles, you wouldn’t get the exhilaration of crossing the finish line and the satisfaction of officially achieving a commendable, well-defined goal that other people recognize and admire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But is reading a book really about reading every single page that someone put between two covers? On principle, I think people would agree reading is about getting exposed to ideas that inform and influence the way we think.
Surely, then, we can be done with a book regardless of whether we read it from beginning to end.
And if we’ve “finished” the book in this way, shouldn’t we walk away satisfied and guilt-free?</p></div>

<h3 id="break-your-new-years-resolution">Break Your New Year’s Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting a goal number of books to read can foster the habit of reading regularly, a habit we all admire and covet.
However, it’s easy to get carried away with trying to make measurable progress at the expense of approaching your actual goal.
If you get fixated on officially finishing a book, you might be forgetting why you wanted to read it in the first place.
By ditching a book when you feel you’ve had enough of it, you’re staying true to the real reason you set that goal of reading some special number of books by Christmas time.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41181911">Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</a> by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann, the authors tell a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">true story</a> about a government that offered civilians bounty for killing rats in an effort to mitigate the local rat infestation.
Specifically, they offered people money for each rat tail they brought in.
They figured they could reliably track progress on the pest problem without having to handle the corpses.
The plan backfired completely.
Crafty entrepreneurs realized that they could capture a rat, cut off its tail, and then release it, so that it would live on to reproduce: more rats, more tails, more money.
The pest problem worsened significantly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But why all the gossip about rodents and dishonest bounty hunters? Well, Weinberg and McCann’s point is that metrics can be counterproductive.
In the case of reading books, if you worry too much about how many books you’ve read front-to-back, you stray from your objective of learning and growing.
Maybe you should change your metric or add a new one: the number of books checked out of the library, or the number of books you read for at least one hour.
Anything that helps you make real progress and not counting rat tails.</p></div>

<h3 id="avoid-the-sunk-cost-fallacy">Avoid the Sunk-Cost Fallacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Books aren’t perfect.
Many of them are good.
Many others are just okay.
Sometimes, you benefit by leaving a book unfinished and moving on to another instead of persevering through to the end, regardless of how far you’ve made it.
In that case, by quitting the book, you’re overriding a psychological flaw and making a more rational choice.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>sunk-cost fallacy</strong>, as defined in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman is:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We fall prey to this error when we stick stubbornly with a book just because of the time we’ve already sunk into it.
If this book is no longer doing it for you, move on.
There are millions of other books and many of them are better than this one.
If you can cut your losses and push through the unpleasantness that comes with doing so, you’ve likely made the optimal choice.</p></div>

<h3 id="read-other-books">Read Other Books</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you feel guilty about not finishing a book you’re currently reading, you probably won’t start a new book.
And so, if the book you’re reading loses your interest, you’ll end up losing steam and maybe reading no book at all.
Unless it is important to you to finish this specific book, why not move on and keep your momentum going? By leaving a book unfinished and feeling good about it, you allow yourself to start a new book with excitement instead of guilt.</p></div>

<h3 id="youre-not-absorbing-much-anymore">You’re Not Absorbing Much Anymore</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve all finished reading a paragraph only to realize that we didn’t absorb much of the information at all.
It can happen when we’re having trouble focusing, but it can also happen when you’ve lost interest.
That’s okay.
It might be time to move on.
Life is long, you can come back to this book in some weeks, months, or even years if it’s a book you think is worth reading eventually.
By moving on, you are valuing results above all else.</p></div>

<h3 id="sacrifice-depth-for-breadth">Sacrifice Depth for Breadth</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you learn to ditch books with confidence, you’ll cover more variety of material.
I think this is true not only because you start the next book sooner, but also because you avoid the reading slump you’ll inevitably hit when you’ve committed to a book that you have no interest in reading.
By moving on to another book, you’re covering more ground when it isn’t worth staying put and drilling down for more.</p></div>

<h3 id="its-not-worth-your-time">It’s Not Worth Your Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might benefit a lot from a book early on, but less so in later chapters.
Perhaps you’ve effectively satisfied your curiosity, or maybe the book’s value is distributed unevenly across its sections.
Regardless, you’re facing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> and the book might not be worth your time anymore.
By ditching the book, you’re reacting intelligently to a waning profit.</p></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we choose to finish a book, let’s make that choice for a good reason, and not because leaving it unfinished feels like failure.
Moreover, let’s relish the opportunity to make the smart, if counterintuitive, choice of bailing on a book when it isn’t worth the time.
If we overcome the mental hurdles that stop us from ditching a book even when we are justified, we’ll be free to read more widely and engage more deeply.</p></div>

<p>I have some free time right now.
Should I read or should I write?
<!--more-->
I’ve learned to choose by checking in with my body.
Do I feel an appetite for absorbing new information?
Or do I feel a need to express myself in some way?
In other words, am I feeling </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work"><em>absorptive</em> or <em>productive</em></a><p>?</p>
</div>

<div>
    <span style="float: left">← productive  </span>
    <span style="float: right">  absorptive →</span>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Classifying my mood on that simple criterion has helped me a lot.
When I’m feeling <em>productive</em>, I know I’ll have a hard time quieting my mind to read.
And when I’m feeling <em>absorptive</em>, I know it’s a great time to make progress on a book.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently it occurred to me I could add more binary tests like this one.
After I determine I feel like consuming rather than producing, I might ask myself whether I feel like doing something <em>active</em> or something <em>passive</em>.
Watching TV for example can be active or passive depending on whether you watch a documentary about an unfamiliar topic or rewatch your favorite sitcom.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>By adding a second axis, we upgrade our binary test into a matrix.
And the more criteria we add, the more precisely we can chart our moods.</p></div>

<div>
    <span style="float: left">← active  </span>
    <span style="float: right">  passive →</span>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a mood to expend energy or do you need to refuel?
The same answer will have different implications for different people.
For introverted people, having “expensive” capacity at a given moment offers an opportunity to socialize.
For extroverted people, it might be a good chance to attend to personal chores.</p></div>

<div>
    <span style="float: left">← expensive  </span>
    <span style="float: right">  regenerative →</span>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After determining that you want to watch a movie – a fine choice when one is feeling passive-absorptive-regenerative, by the way – you can figure out whether you want to do your passive absorbing alone or with other people.</p></div>

<div>
    <span style="float: left">← individual  </span>
    <span style="float: right">  social →</span>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While going through this exercise, you don’t have to pick a point on each spectrum.
I think it’s unlikely you’ll have answers for all.
(Ah yes, I’m feeling productive-active-social-regenerative, that’s the word I was looking for!)
But with every choice, you filter down many possible activities into the ones best suited to your current mood.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a social-regenerative mood?
Meet with friends to do something that nourishes you.
Or are you feeling social-expensive?
Do something that you’re not easily motivated to do but that your loved ones want to do with you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Choosing an activity based on how you’re feeling in the moment is a good way to evade the taxing experience of forcing yourself to do something through willpower alone.
But learning how your moods and energy levels fluctuate is also useful for planning.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s important to notice which activities are expensive for you.
Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, dedicate your expensive mood to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">meaningful, important work</a><p>.
Make time afterwards for your regenerative activites.
Whether you’re more introverted or extroverted, take note of how often you need social interaction to keep a healthy balance.
If producing is important to you, dedicate time to absorbing as well.
