Fitted sheet and a duvet, no top sheet.

The duvet cover must offer a way to secure the duvet inside it so that it appears and feels like one item.
What has worked well in my experience is a duvet covet with eight ties inside it and a zipper at the bottom hidden behind a flap.</p></div>

        <blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Does the brain control you, or are you controlling the brain? I don’t know if I’m in charge of mine.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Karl Pilkington sounds foolish, but he’s onto something.
He tells an anecdote about a time when he finished his grocery list and moved on only to be interrupted by a thought that entered his mind suddenly: <em>Apple</em>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>That was weird — who reminded me of that?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The thought of apple just appeared and Karl doesn’t know how.
It fell like a raindrop into his mind.
This happens to us all the time, but we don’t notice it because we expect it.
We think <em>What’s his name again?</em> and then something inside us slips an answer into our grasp: <em>Mark</em>.
It’s like shaking a tree until fruit falls out.
We don’t give the tree much credit.
But Karl was leaving the orchard when the apple came rolling after him.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We talk about the subconscious as a mysterious engine that runs the dreams we soon forget after we wake up.
But it’s also there in the day.
It hums along softly in the background, chiming in helpfully when we need to remember someone’s name or what produce to buy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But it’s more than our assistant.
It’s our advisor, our consigliere.
It’s the source of our gut feelings.
Great ideas come from interaction with this humble inner partner, this invisible thinker.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite being teased by his buddies for his story about the apple, Karl echoed something the French polymath Poincaré wrote in his essay, Mathematical Creation:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>At the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Karl, Poincaré tells stories of answers coming to him when he was no longer considering the question.
And he welcomes it.
He recognizes his subconscious mind as a vital actor in his work, a shrewd associate that finds a fresh lead while he rests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Poincaré then concludes something that Karl would’ve been mocked for saying: resting is productive.
Not because it reenergizes you for more work, but because it is work.
Rest releases the invisible thinker to explore and find what you haven’t noticed yet.
You can feel this happening in the shower when novel ideas surface in your mind without prompt.
And though we can’t steer our “ambient thought”, we can <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">tell it what to think about</a>.
As Don Draper of Mad Men tells his protégé:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Peggy, just – think about it. Deeply. Then forget it. And an idea will jump up in your face.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our train of thought springs into existence already in motion and it speeds between ideas connected by tracks in our mind.
Though we cannot access the underlying web of knowledge directly, we experience the result of its traversal.
And by training and ruminating on new ideas we integrate them into the network.
This is why jazz musicians can fling out new melodies every night.
A chord change played by the backing band illuminates melodic pathways carved into the musician’s mind during training.
At the gig they just get behind their instrument and go for a ride.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We tap into these networks not only for spontaneous improvisation but also for careful design.
We draw from a well of memories and impressions, questions and conclusions, recreating and appropriating them for new purposes.
A musician composes from real feelings, from their desires and their fears.
A fiction writer sketches a character from the outlines of real people, from the beauties they’ve admired and faults they’ve despised.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This personal reservoir is where filmmaker David Lynch fishes for the strange and abstract ideas that appear in his work.
In his book Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity, Lynch describes his process more as catching ideas than creating them.
He receives ideas from something inside himself, and consults this inner source to develop and implement them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lynch isn’t the only prolific artist with a mysterious inner partner.
Novelist Cormac McCarthy is well aware of his own collaborator.
He said:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Writing can be like taking dictation.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Poincaré and Pilkington, McCarthy has talked about the mysterious experience of receiving answers from the ether:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I’d been thinking about [the problem] off and on for a couple of years without making much progress.
Then one morning…as I was emptying [the wastebasket] into the kitchen trash I suddenly knew the answer.
Or I knew that I knew the answer.
It took me a minute or so to put it together.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>McCarthy often talks about the Night Shift, the period when we sleep and the invisible thinker takes over.
Pilkington agrees – from his book The Moaning of Life:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I think I’m more intelligent in my dreams than I am when I’m awake… A few months ago I went to bed with a problem, fell asleep thinking about it and when I woke up I had a solution.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The invisible thinker rules this hidden world where our creativity lives.
It collaborates with us to devise and improvise, and it even thinks for itself.
When relieved from its duty as our advisor, it roams freely, eager to satisfy its own curiosity.
We heighten our creative potential when we deepen understanding with our internal agent.
Especially if we don’t just ask but also listen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage — whose name is self. In your body he dwells; he is your body. There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> (Kauffman translation, 1954, p.146)</p></div>

        <div class="paragraph"><p>The standard bathtub-shower design seems like a good idea.
<!--more-->
Two in one.
But <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Design_by_committee">the compromise</a> at the heart of its design prevents it from being a good shower.
The cost of the compromise is hidden in plain sight, difficult to notice due to its ubiquity.
Allow me to shed some light on the ways that the tub compromises the shower.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the uncomfortable task of having to <em>climb</em> in, over a literal barrier, without any clothes to soften accidental contact.
Clearing this hurdle is not merely a matter of stepping high and long because on the other side one must balance onefooted on a skinny, slippery ramp with sloping edges.
It’s shockingly inhospitable ground considering its primary aim is to allow a bipedal, softskinned animal to stand barefooted in showering water and contort while applying lubricants that ooze dangerously downwards onto an already slick surface.
But we’re used to this design, so we don’t notice its baffling unfriendliness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>If freed from the responsibility of doubling as a tub, a shower can focus on being a good shower.
It can be easy to enter and to exit.
Its standing ground, unobliged to accommodate the bare backside, can be tiled or otherwise surfaced with material that gives traction to the bare foot, even when covered in soapy water.
The dimensions can be square and wide enough to allow a person to turn and easily rinse different parts of their body without having to watch their step or feel unreasonably constricted.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean while <a id="2021-02-01-think-invisibly" class="" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">their mind wanders</a>.
To achieve this, it must make it extremely easy to do all the basic things: get in, stand, wash, rinse, and get out.
The tubshower hybrid most of us have at home fails this basic test.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/good-shower" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bonus points for nice tiles and for a flat entry with no intermediary ledge.</p></div>

<h3 id="iii-diffused--ambient-lighting">iii) diffused &amp; ambient lighting</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I hate overhead lighting that is bright and direct.
The inconvenience of switching off five lamps in a living room is nothing compared to having to withstand the piercing glare of bare bulbs shining down horribly into my eyes.
For switch-operated room lights, I much prefer track lighting aimed at the wall or lights diffused by rice paper pendants.
The goal is to create a <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTsun7JQzd0off7M8o5DlJ983OV63snW?si=xKxDqYwS4oq-6glt">soup of light</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, as per pattern #252, <em>pools of light</em>, lights should accentuate or even delineate spaces and subspaces.
Don’t just light a whole room, light each space within the room.
And, importantly, “spaces” should be defined by human activity and experience: a private corner where you or your loved ones sit to read, an area where a little group may sit to talk or play games, etc.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently, while visiting Halifax, Nova Scotia, my wife Z and I sat in the corner of a coffee shop, admiring its beautiful interior.
Throughout our trip, I had been pointing out places where patterns were applied or might have been.
Suddenly I realized we were sitting in one.
#179 <em>alcoves</em> calls for a subspace within a larger space to which a subgroup of the larger group can retreat to socialize in partial privacy without vacating the bigger communal space, thereby conserving the feeling of connection that comes with sharing space with others.
(While writing this I notice that coffee shops are a place where it is crucial to create alcoves, and not just once, but many times over.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The pattern calls for a lowered ceiling, which suggests that the pattern be planned during construction.
(In fact, this imperative is codified as a general pattern: #207 <em>structure follows social spaces</em>.)
But the coffee shop used a clever alternative to achieve a similar effect: they placed a light fixture directly above our corner seating and brought it down to a low height so that it functioned like a lowered ceiling.
This technique merges #179 <em>alcoves</em> and #252 <em>pools of light</em> in the way that the book likens to poetry:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In a poem, the meaning is far more dense [than in prose]. Each word carries several meanings; and the sentence as a whole carries an enormous density of interlocking meanings, which together illuminate the whole.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>The same is true for pattern languages. It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a rather loose way. A building made like this, is an assembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible to put patterns together in such a way that many many patterns overlap in the same physical space: the building is very dense; it has many meanings captured in a small space; and through this density, it becomes profound.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="iv-plants">iv) plants</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Especially leafy ones.
Pothos, monstera, ficus.
I’m not a huge fan of aloe veras or succulents.
Snake plants are ok.</p></div>

<h3 id="v-comfy-couch">v) comfy couch</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Whenever I see a home tour on YouTube and it lacks a cushy sofa in the living room, I mourn it.
Armchairs and chairs are not enough.
For me, couches are fundamental.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am picky how the couch feels to sit on, too.
I think I prefer a slightly low and certainly a deep seat.
Its texture and color matter, too.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, see pattern #251, <em>different chairs</em>, which provides seating variety to create options for different people or the same people in different moods.</p></div>

<h3 id="vi-dishwasher">vi) dishwasher</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t like to wash dishes by hand.
It takes so long.
And it feels meaningless, unlike other chores, like plant watering.
Plus, I’m prone to excema.</p></div>

<h3 id="vii-ample-natural-light">vii) ample natural light</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I need big and many windows.
In the living room, at least, artificial lighting should be optional in the daytime.
Northfacing windowsills (in the northern hemisphere) are fantastic for plants.
Direct sunlight is nice, even if just a little bit.</p></div>

<h3 id="viii-coffee-setup">viii) coffee setup</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preferrably an espresso machine with a grinder with a portafilter holder.
At least, a pourover setup: a gooseneck kettle, a cone dripper, a scale, and a burr grinder.</p></div>

<h3 id="ix-tv-with-a-good-sound-system">ix) TV with a good sound system</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Makes me sad to watch movies on TV speakers.</p></div>

<h3 id="x-artwork">x) artwork</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the walls.
Nothing fancy.
Nicelooking stuff and stuff with personal significance (see pattern #253, <em>things from your life</em>).
Not generic or massproduced prints.
Trendy interior design brands have ruined Matisse figure prints, at least for a few years.</p></div>

<h3 id="xi-worktable-with-a-monitor">xi) worktable with a monitor</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I say worktable instead of desk because my current worktable is actually our dinner table.
It’s a great setup because we don’t use it much otherwise.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preferrably with a big table surface.
Bonus points for a mounted monitor that doesn’t take up any deskspace and can be swiveled out of the way.</p></div>

<h3 id="xii-nice-dishware">xii) nice dishware</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I like an assortment of glasses and mugs.
Nice shapes, materials, and weight.
Uniform cutlery.
Matching set of dishes, bowls, and bowl plates.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t care for the massproduced mugs, regardless of what image or words are imprinted on them.
I like large handles so that it is easy to hold the mug with one hand without touching or bumping into the hot mug’s sidesurface.</p></div>

<h3 id="xiii-easy--fast-access-to-street">xiii) easy &amp; fast access to street</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s annoying to fish for my keys or a fob to unlock doors.
For that reason, I sometimes prefer parking on the street than in a garage.
In general, I love being able to walk out of my home and virtually straight onto the street.
I like views but they’re not worth long elevator waits.
A view of a nice neighborhood street or leafy trees is enough for me.</p></div>

<h3 id="xiv-places-to-set-things-down">xiv) places to set things down</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m a strong believer in having a designated place at the entrance for placing house keys upon entry.
(Also, see <em>(c) cultivate meaning in objects and places</em>.)
And I recently noticed that there’s a similar satisfaction in having places throughout the house for settings things down.
A surface next to each seat for setting down a drink.
A convenient place to put items that you use regularly like spatulas, toothbrushes, towels, bathrobes, kitchen trays, and so on.
A loading deck of sorts at the bottom and top of staircases, where one can set down things than need to be brought up or down at a nonurgent time.
A common case for this kind of inbetween surface is to set down glasses, mugs, and other bits that need to be brought to the kitchen.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A key aspect of these places is that they are convenient (see <em>(a) avoid causes of mental clutter &amp; friction</em>).
It shouldn’t be necessary, for example, to activate your core to pick up or set down when sitting anywhere in the living room.
There should be a spot right there, within reach from a natural sitting position.</p></div>

<h3 id="xv-good-sinks-faucets--handles">xv) good sinks, faucets, &amp; handles</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Faucets that stream water onto the edge of the sink bowl drive me crazy.
As you wet your hands water spills and splashes out where it shouldn’t.
It is the criminal how many flashylooking sinks I’ve used that have this problem.
Nothing is uglier than a beautiful thing that works poorly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another avoidable problem that survives through all sorts of absurd mutations of pernicious design is that of shower and sink handles.
It’s insane that we so often have to ask for help with turning on a shower.
Why do we need so many different designs?
And for the love of all that is good, why can’t we make it clear which way is hot and which cold?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The ideal is one, intuitive control.
It should also be easy to shut off immediately.
None of this multirotation nonsense.
I’m not sure we even need more than 180˚ of rotation per handle.</p></div>

<h3 id="xvi-rounded-edges">xvi) rounded edges</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Passing a rounded corner is satisfying in a subtle way.
I suppose it’s natural to walk in curved lines, unnatural to walk in jagged ones.
I like rounded table edges, rounded walls, even rounded stairs.
They’re not necessary in every case, but they make a difference when located along circulation paths.
It’s nice not having to move past a straight edge and then turn at a sharp angle.</p></div>

<h3 id="xvii-boundaries--thresholds">xvii) boundaries &amp; thresholds</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the complement to <em>rounded edges</em>.
In some cases, instead of smoothening the transition from one place to another, it’s best to demarcate it.
For example, in cases where the kitchen area and the living room are effectively in the same room, it’s nice to add a step between them so that a distinction is felt.
A home can be made to feel bigger simply by demarcating spaces with distinct purposes.</p></div>

        <blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>most…wonderful places of the world were not made by architects, but by the people.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>That’s a quote from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language"><em>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction</em></a>, a book published in 1977 that I came across a few years ago while thumbing through the Seattle Public Library’s virtual collection on Libby.
Something about the unusual title and the minimal, uncommercial cover called to me.
I checked it out, perused it with intrigue, then put it aside.
I spent scant time with it, but its basic idea stuck with me.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The book lists two hundred and fiftythree of these, spanning in scope from regions to rooms and graded with the degree of confidence that the authors have in the solution’s indispensability.
Despite being defined loosely to allow flexible application, the patterns are also defined concretely, often specified with numerical precision and illustrated with pictures and drawings.
The patterns are grouped in small categories within broader sections and each pattern references various others so that they are all connected in a network of relationships.
Forward references elucidate how larger patterns depend on smaller ones and backreferences contextualize patterns in larger ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I find the approach – flexible, referential, and associative – rather appealing.
In fact, the book abides by various principles of my <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a> idea, namely: multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, and nonmonolithic.
As a big fan of wikis, I’m pleased to read that it inspired the <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/WikiWikiWeb">first online wiki</a>.
And as a programmer, I’m gratified to discover it inspired the idea of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Software_design_pattern">software design patterns</a>, which are a core part of the software engineering vernacular.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The book is, finally, an inspiration for me to create <a id="2024-08-19-my-pattern-language" class="" href="/vbook/my-pattern-language">my own pattern language</a>.
I love interior design, placemaking, vibesetting, and lately I’ve been thinking about what elements make a homespace great.
I’ve loved furnishing, laying out, and decorating my apartments, and I look forward to owning a house someday.</p></div>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
Thanks to its relative obscurity, the ebook version was available to borrow immediately from the library.
I’m pleased to find out the authors encourage readers to come up with their own pattern languages.
It occurs to me that some of the my patterns might have some tacit principles in common.
I want to deduce them and make them explicit so I can reference them from relevant patterns and thereby uncover principles that underpin my whole pattern language.</p></div>

<h3 id="a-avoid-causes-of-mental-clutter--friction">a) avoid causes of mental clutter &amp; friction</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m trying to articulate the common principle, assuming there is one, between my preference for <em>(i)</em> a sole duvet and for <em>(ii) a walk-in shower</em>.
In the same way I resent having to think about stepping into a bathtub and about where I step while I shower, I resent having to keep track of a top sheet while in bed.
I much prefer to interact exclusively with the duvet.
I am aware that it sounds contrived or even slightly insane, but these things cause me minor mental friction that I wish I could eliminate in totality.
I love to relax my mind, and it’s hard to do so when distracted by little frills and imperfections.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think there are many little bits in my patterns that can be traced to my intolerance for mental friction.
My distaste for <em>(xiii)</em> having to unlock doors on my way out of my home or having to wait an indeterminate amount of time for an elevator.
My preference for <em>(xii)</em> big mug handles, so I don’t have worry about holding the mug a certain way to avoid burning my knuckles.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nowadays it’s easy for me to take for granted the convenience of bluetooth headphones, but, years ago, wired headphones caused me constant psychological chafe.
It irked me to have to supervise that pesky dangling cord and it momentarily ruined my calm when it got yanked out of my ears unexpectedly.
To minimize the probability of it catching on protruding bits, like the jagged knobs of our kitchen cabinets, I used to run the cord up my shirt along my back, out through the neckhole, and into my ears like I was in the secret service.
(This was my variant of the common practice of running headphones under the shirt on the <em>front</em> side, which had the issue that, when not in use, the cord would dangle and swing down in front of you.)
I bought my first pair of cordless headphones in 2018 and they were a revelation.
The freedom was exquisite.</p></div>

<h3 id="b-allow-for-incremental-discovery-and-gradual-changes">b) allow for incremental discovery and gradual changes</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realized how much I love walk-in showers because my current Seattle apartment has one.
In fact, I love it so much that, when we got a roommate, I requested continued access to the bathroom where it is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Living in different places and in different arranagements is a great way to learn what you like best and what you can’t do without.
(This is one of the perks of renting, I think.)
I learned, for example, how important it is for my wife Z to have a room to be alone in by sharing with her a one bedroom apartment that had minimal architectural division or sound insulation between bedroom and living room.
We covered the french doors with curtains to create visual separation, but that didn’t do much to muffle sound.
The important fact was not whether she was alone or not, it what whether she <em>felt</em> like she was in a private place to unwind and recharge.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Experimentation is possible also within a single home.
For example, I’ve been able to relocate my various plants within the apartment many times, especially the ones that sit on individual wooden stools, which are easy to move and fit into small spaces.
The same is possible with artwork, especially if you use command strips or some other hanging device that leaves no trace.</p></div>

<h3 id="c-cultivate-meaning-in-objects-and-places">c) cultivate meaning in objects and places</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A place for keys at the entrance is convenient for arrival and departure, and it effects a pleasant sense of transition.
Arriving, it feels nice to unburden oneself of logistical paraphernalia necessary for navigating the world outside, which accentuates the feeling of returning to a place of convenience, comfort, and familiarity.
The inverse is true as well.
On departure, it feels nice to equip oneself before stepping through the doorway into the world.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ordinary actions like these can have meaning.
This imbuing of meaning into inanimate objects and impersonal surroundings is part of the process that transforms house into home.
A building or even a room becomes a place where one is provided for and made feel secure, where one can rest at ease.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A home is sprinkled with meaning throughout.
A quiet, comfy place to read and relax.
A welcoming common area to be together.
A room of one’s own, a private space.
All these are ordinary physical spaces that provide precious and intangible nourishment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s obvious that negative meanings undermine a home.
But neutrality and meaninglessness do as well.
Each bit and each place devoid of meaning is like a little leak out of which seeps out the precious feeling of hominess.
They silently steal from our home’s potential as a place for rest and renewal.</p></div>

<h3 id="d-make-things-adjustable">d) make things adjustable</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>TVs that can be turned sideways, pulled forward, and pushed back.
Lamps that can be tweaked into different angles, pointed in different directions, or even carried around the home.
Little tables that can be displaced and replaced to accommodate brief activities.
Stools that can be conjured and banished.
Couch cushions that can be tilted and propped up into convenient positions.
Coffee tabletops that can be lifted up towards the sofa.
A computer monitor that can be swiveled in and out of the way.
Retractable awnings covering patios and balconies – see pattern #244, <em>canvas roofs</em>.
In these there’s a joy akin to that of the bluetooth speaker, the laptop, and a pair of wireless headphones.
A degree of freedom and flexibility that may sound trivial but gives so much satisfaction.</p></div>
