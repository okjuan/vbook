        <div class="paragraph"><p>I started buying houseplants about four years ago.
I bought two from the grocery store and promptly killed one.
I think I overwatered it.
Or maybe it got infested by some tiny plant killers.
I don’t know.
 <del>To be honest,</del> I didn’t try very hard to save it.
I wanted my apartment to have that green leafy look but I didn’t want to sink time and effort into research.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Apart from that early casualty, my approach of low involvement has worked pretty well.
The  <del>second</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">other</ins>  plant – a lemon-lime dracaena – has thrived.
I’ve repotted it multiple times and it stands today at <del>a height</del>  two or three times  <del>the original.</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">its original height.</ins> 
I’m <del>somewhat</del>  proud of  <del>it.</del> 
 <del>Some</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">it, somewhat.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">Several</ins>  of its leaves are  <ins class="revision-insertion">partially</ins>  browned with decay  <del>for</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">due to</ins>  some reason I’ve neglected to investigate, but  <ins class="revision-insertion">nonetheless</ins>  it lives  <del>on, nonetheless.</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">on.</ins></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Every now and then I get the motivation to watch YouTube videos to learn how to perform certain tasks of plant care.
The people who make these videos tend to chat at the camera for a while, stroking and poking their plants as they slowly approach the subject at hand.
I <del>often</del>  watch these videos  <del>impatiently and jump</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">impatiently, jumping</ins>  forward  <ins class="revision-insertion">with irritation</ins>  until I find the bits of information I need.
 <ins class="revision-insertion">I want to get the task done as quickly as possible.</ins> 
I find it difficult to enjoy the process.
 <del>I just want to get the task done as quickly as possible.</del></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s a funny thing to find yourself  <del>resentfully doing</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">resenting</ins>  chores  <del>that you’ve</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">you</ins>  created for yourself.
Nobody and no thing  <del>requires</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">require</ins>  that I have plants in my  <del>home,</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">home</ins>  and yet I have several.
Five in the bedroom, one in the living room, three in the kitchen, one in the bathroom, and seven in the office.
 <del>Most</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">Many</ins>  of  <del>them</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">these are second or third generation houseplants that</ins>  I planted <del>myself,</del>  from <del>propagated</del>  snippings  <del>of</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">I trimmed and propagated in water.</ins></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><ins class="revision-insertion">I stopped buying</ins>  plants  <ins class="revision-insertion">a while ago and yet I keep accumulating more of them.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">The list above is almost twenty in number without including my biggest and oldest plants, which are back in my apartment in Seattle, 238km away.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">Over there I have my lemon-lime dracaena, a sizeable monstera, a growing ficus, a tentacled pothos, and several other smaller plants.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">The better job</ins>  I  <del>bought.</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">do at caring for my plants, the more they thrive and the greater my responsibilities become.</ins></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><del>At this point, their upkeep outranks the pleasure they give me.</del> 
 <del>The list above doesn’t amount to twenty in number, but it also doesn’t include my biggest and oldest plants, which are back in my apartment in Seattle.</del> 
 <del>There I have my lemon-lime dracaena, a sizeable monstera, a growing ficus, a tentacled pothos, and several other smaller plants.</del> 
Watering plants is a surprisingly effortful task, especially when you have to water many all at once.
 <del>Some demand that</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">For some,</ins>  I stand on  <del>tip toes</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">tiptoes</ins>  and  <del>hold</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">extend</ins>  my arm  <del>extended and rigid</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">rigidly</ins>  overhead to let a stream of water arc into the pot.
For others, I do a mini deadlift and lug their fragile figures to the tub.
Any spills I mop up on my hands and knees.
A long way from lounging on the couch and enjoying my living room.
 <ins class="revision-insertion">Sometimes, I feel that the work their upkeep demands has surpassed the pleasure they give me.</ins></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For a long time I accumulated plants and grew them with the aim of making my living room lush with  <del>leafy green.</del> 
 <del>And eventually,</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">green leaves.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">Eventually,</ins>  I realized the vision.
And I loved it.
But, as is often the case, the happily ever after is a lot more tedious than  <del>a vision of a frozen future</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">its still image</ins>  suggests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am living a weird life.
It isn’t one I dreamed up for myself, but one that has developed bit by bit over the years from the conditions imposed on me by life.
Enviously I’ve held onto everything in my grasp and years later I find myself sprawled across two <del>cities across two</del>  countries, in two  <del>apartments overrun by plants.</del> 
 <del>Abundance enriches just as it encumbers.</del> 
 <del>I think</del>  <ins class="revision-insertion">apartments, both full of houseplants.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">This abundance has enriched my life while encumbering it.</ins> 
 <ins class="revision-insertion">Perhaps</ins>  it’s time to lighten the burdens I’ve put upon myself.</p></div>
