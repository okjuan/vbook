But this is a book for which my esteem deteriorated with time. I enjoyed it with enthusiasm while I read it, but my attitude didn&#39;t keep. There is something rather selfconscious about Kurt Vonnegut and it comes across not only in his selfdeprecating manner as an interviewee but in this book&#39;s overt quirkiness, its unsubtle sociopolitical commentary, and finally in Vonnegut&#39;s selfinsertion as a character. I suspect he sabotages his image as a serious writer of literature as preemptive defense against failing to be one. It doesn&#39;t help his case. I will read &lt;em&gt;Cat&#39;s Cradle&lt;/em&gt; next and see how my opinion of him evolves.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Wise Blood&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;by Flannery O&#39;Connor&quot;,&quot;image_url&quot;:&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1223675478i/337107.jpg&quot;,&quot;commentary&quot;:&quot;This book is tainted by the fact that Flannery O&#39;Connor &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/22/how-racist-was-flannery-oconnor&#39;&gt;was racist&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose she is a bit like her protagonist Hazel Moates – unable to extract the figure moving from tree to tree in the back of her mind, unable to shed the doctrine of repression bestowed upon her from childhood. And this tendency in herself she evaluates in the same bizarre way she evaluates the one in Hazel: not as a moral failing, but as a sign of integrity. A virtue of loyalty. Just as Hazel cannot escape his Catholic guilt instilled in upbringing, she cannot betray the racist \&quot;values\&quot; of her community because, as she said about a suggested meeting in her state of Georgia with fellow writer James Baldwin, &lt;em&gt;it would cause the greatest trouble and disturbance and disunion.&lt;/em&gt; It&#39;s a strange thing for an artist of enduring aesthetic freshness to espouse such stale, backwards views. Art may have been for her not an escape but an escape from an escape.&quot;}]"

Most our group were out paddleboarding on the lake but three of us remained onshore beneath the trees. We found each our own spot along the water and for a long while nobody spoke. I lay in a hammock reading and then pausing to listen. Overhead the breeze gushed through the trees, bowing their branches and stirring their leaves into a soft chatter. Sunshine washed over the treetops and trickled down through layers of lattice in quivering shapes onto the ground. Below me water lapped up against the shore, knocking together pieces of driftwood in a sloppy rhythm. For weeks that followed an inner sense of peace and calm endured within my body. I felt connected, synced up. Today I keep this book by bed although I&#39;ve learned alone it can&#39;t restore that feeling. More than it, I need stillness. I need time for easy communal with my body and the rest of nature.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How to Love&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;by Thich Nhat Hahn&quot;,&quot;image_url&quot;:&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415678203i/22309627.jpg&quot;,&quot;commentary&quot;:&quot;Here I will write a bit about this book.
